I was making time with your girl.	N
And here I made you all hot and sweaty...	N
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse.	N
A little advice about feelings kiddo; don't expect it always to tickle.	Y
I mean there's someone besides your mother you've got to forgive.	N
Don King talks black, lives white and thinks green.	N
And now they got you up against George Foreman.	N
Ain't no Vietcong ever called me nigger.	N
I'm no Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap Brown...	N
You look like the heavyweight champion of pimps.	N
There's no "back" to take you to...	N
I'm Bruce Nolan with Eyewitness Nose... Eyewitness Nose... that's right!	N
Well, I guess that's the way life works, isn't it?	N
And that's the way the cookie crumbles.	N
Any word on the open anchor position, Jack?	N
How much can a man give to his country?	N
Where can I get a cab back to town?	N
I kind of felt that he kind of felt that if I kind of told you that you'd know that he knew that you knew... or something.	N
Well, he didn't say in so many words that ever since you started with that house you haven't turned in a decent piece of copy, but --	N
You've been taken to the cleaners, and you don't even know your pants are off.	N
And besides, you're not getting fifty acres, you're only getting thirty- five, more or less.	N
So you hit a spring, a bubbling spring... right here, in our cellar.	N
With a few minor deviations I know exactly where every penny is going --	N
Dylan... until mommy gets back... whatever you do don't fall asleep.	Y
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.	N
I am Ard... Supreme Leader of The Revolution and Next Ruler of The World.	N

There was no way I was gonna walk around this place with my dork hanging out!	N
I kept thinking I was going to run out of air, but my new body worked great.	N
If you refuse, you die; she dies... everybody dies!	Y
She's sleeping, but only I can awaken her.	N
If you were any less black, you'd be clear.	N
If you let them in here, they will kill you.	N
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there.	N
I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--	N
Don't tease me, you know what I do for a living.	Y
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....	N
I'll go put these in some rubbing alcohol.	N
We haven't seen each other since high school.	N
Well, a son is a poor substitute for a lover.	N
She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.	N
We're always quickest to doubt people who have a reputation for being honest.	N
Look, this isn't much, but it might make you feel a little better.	N
She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother.	N
There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...	N
I think I must have one of those faces you can't help believing.	N
I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...	N
Well, if it doesn't jell, it isn't aspic, and this ain't jellin'!	N
This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.	N
I brought you nectarines cause the peaches were hard as rocks	N
And then we all smiled, and it was a great minute.	N
Like I said, it ain't me you gotta worry about.	N
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh?	N
Did not know who he was fuckin' with.	N
Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.	N

Reckon you make me some biscuits.	Y
Me and him's made friends.	N
I like them French fried potaters.	N

A shovel just makes too goddamned much racket.	N
By the way, how was it out there?	N
Ben, if you mixed drinks that way you mixed metaphors, you'd be out of a job...	N
Do either of you have any idea when they stopped using that site as a rifle range?	N
Son, you got a talent for stating the obvious.	N
Little greaser sonofabitch been running a goddarn bus service.	N
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.	N
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.	N
I've got a goddamn plan!	N
No way they could stop it.	N
I wouldn't give you a gun if it were World War 3.	N
We go out, we find those damn snake things, we make 'em extinct.	Y
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget that I run a business?	N
If I don't see it in front of me, you're right.	N
You know, a good cop will never let you know he knows you're full of shit.	N
Excuse me, but my wife thinks she left a bag of beach towels in the fitting room?	N
Half a million dollars will always be missed.	N
I know the type, trust me on this.	N
Shut your raggedy-ass up, and sit the fuck down!	Y
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.	N
My ass may be dumb, but I ain't no dumbass.	N
That's why she's givin' up my money huh?	N
You can't trust Melanie but you can trust Melanie to be Melanie.	N
If this is about you fucked Melanie, I don't give a damn.	N
Don't you puke on my shoes Harry.	Y
I need you to do me a favor .	N
They say the fucking smog is the fucking reason you have such beautiful fucking sunsets.	N
Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.	N
The guy's been in town two days, and already he thinks he's David O. Fucking Selznick.	N
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint.	N
I got an idea for a movie.	N
The door from the patio, in back.	N
Where's Chili Palmer, where's Leo DeVoe... *where's* my fuckin' money?	N
Forget all the bullshit from before -- I don't even remember how it started.	N
I'm the guy who's telling you the way it is.	N
You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.	Y
What is the point of living in L.A. if you're not in the movie business?	N
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?	N
Do you remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople, and walked out with the Bank of Constantinople?	N
But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.	N

Just a matter of time, I suppose.	N
I always thought I knew the punchline.	N
We did it right there in the big cauldron.	N
She had lovers, but she saved that for marriage.	N
How can I stop talking about something that's so HUGE?	N
You look so much more attractive when you're self- assured.	N
Unfortunately, you don't have the balls to back up the actions of your huge cock.	N
Put it this way, God made up for what he did to Gumby with Ted here.	N
The dead can return given sufficent motivation.	N
Won't stop until he finds it.	N
You could have picked a better spot.	N
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.	N
I consider myself a nerd.	N
I already saw it once.	N
The future has taken root in the present.	N
But it'll take another, a greater king...	N
Good and evil, there never is one without the other.	N
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.	N

Neither did I. Shit, neither did the studio.	N
I hope one rips the other one's shirt off and we see some fuckin titties floppin around, yeah!	N
Hey, I wanted to go down, but I was waiting until I got to know her a little better.	N
I'm gonna finger-bang her tight little asshole / Finger-bang and tea-bag my balls / Where, where, in her mouth / Balls a-plenty in her mouth / Balls Balls Sweaty Balls	N
You'll have to be faster than Walt Flanagan's Dog to outrun the warrior gorillas, who hunt humans for sport, profit, and the occasional inter- species blow-job.	Y
Dude, I think I just filled the cup.	N
And we got just the thing for that.	N
I don't get out to the movies that much, but "Bluntman and Chronic" was blunt-tastic.	N
These men are the leaders of a terrorist organization wanted for the abduction of a monkey.	N
So you want me to tell you the story of my life?	N
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story.	N
So it was, when I'd given up the search for vampires, that a vampire found me.	N
I think the very name of Paris brought a rush of pleasure to me that was extraordinary.	N
A little child she was, but also a fierce killer, now capable of the ruthless pursuit of blood with all a child's demanding.	N
...and finally, when I could stand it no longer, I stood in an empty desolate street and heard the sound of a child crying.	N
We are predators, Whose all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.	N

I am... so close to puking, you don't wanna know.	N
Don't bother to scream.	Y
We fell from grace together.	N
I'd keep my promises if I were you.	Y
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind.	N
Who knocked up your sister?	N
What 're you talking about?	N
Just 'cause you're beautiful, that doesn't mean that you can treat people like they don't matter.	Y
What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?	N
Leave it to you to use big words when you're smashed.	N
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.	N
And I'm BACK IN THE GAME!	N
She's partial to Joey, not me	N
I guess in this society, being male and an asshole makes you worthy of our time.	N
I'd like to call your attention to Patrick Verona's stunning bad-ass look of 1995 ---	N
I have a dick on my face, don't I?	N
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.	N

It's better if we do this together.	N
She could talk her way out of a sunburn.	N
Yeah, well, that's a Hazard of the jjj...	N
And we were dressed from head to toe in love... the only label that never goes out of style.	N
For the last five months I've been thinking that it's a huge mistake that you left Steve.	N
Yeah, it's all so hot three days in!	N
I let the sex go out of our marriage!	N
Just calling to make sure you aren't hanging from your shower rod.	N
Smith is interested - but the dates will have to work with the series.	N
Yes, the honeymoon to a romantic Mexican resort that I prepaid on my credit card to surprise the man who jilted me.	N
Well, if you change your minds, I know where we can get one hundred beef, seventy-five fish and twenty- five vegetarian meals.	N
It's the last single girl kiss.	N
Enid -- I'm so very flattered but--	N
It wasn't logic, it was love.	N
And speaking of an oldie but goodie...	N
Forty is the last age a woman can be photographed in a wedding dress without the unintended Diane Arbus subtext.	N
It's a once in a lifetime opportunity - so spare me a week of faux soul-searching and just say yes.	Y
Some labels are best left in the closet.	N
It wasn't a fancy designer reception either.	N
It's my lot in life to be surrounded by beautiful women.	N
He said he wrote because he didn't have your phone number.	N

It's more than that -- lately, I haven't been feeling a connection to --	N
Year after year, twenty-something women come to New York City in search of the two L's: labels and love.	N
I had told Louise to put Big in a place where I would never have to hear from him again.	N

Which is why I called them.	N
I curse the day you were born!	N
I've got everything I ever wanted.	N
Here I am, you lucky people!	N
It's a test of skill.	N
Well... You can want in one hand and shit in the other, and see which one fills first.	Y
You gonna say you wouldn't join the Scouts because... him didn't wike his widdle uniform?	N
Why, I'm so scared, I'm so scared, I'm so scared, wo-o-o!	N
Well, he's got about as much chance of one as of the other.	N
You left the cap off the toothpaste again.	N
Spat on the floor as I walked by.	N
To absent friends... To family.	N
You have the bridge, Commander.	Y
You have the bridge... Mr. Troi.	Y
Data, Worf, you're with me.	Y
You're too slow, old man.	N
And you can't contact Starfleet.	Y
For now we see but through a glass darkly.	N
We'll never know what Shinzon might have been.	N
I will always be puzzled by the human predilection for piloting vehicles at unsafe velocities.	N
I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior.	N
Ladies and gentlemen, and invited transgendered species...	N
Geordi, if you will come with me.	N
Can you learn to see in the dark, Captain?	N
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain.	N
You know, all things considered, Data, I think you have nicer eyes.	N
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level.	N
I think it's time to try some unsafe velocities.	N
No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy.	N
Some ideals are worth dying for, aren't they, Jean-Luc?	N
Why should the rest of your crew have to die?	N

I have two arms and ten fingers.	N
Professor Marvel never guesses, he knows!	N
Well, well, well -- house guests, huh?	N

I'd be monarch of all I survey....	N
How about a little fire, Scarecrow?	N
Ah -- now we've got them!	N
A heart is not judged by how much you love; but by how much you are loved by others.	N
Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.	N
Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.	Y
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that?	N
I can barely hear my heart beating!	N
That's what the other man said.	N
I think I'll miss you most of all.	N
Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true!	N
Only bad witches are ugly.	N

Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.	N
Does that make you HORNY?	N
All right, I get it.	N
There's nothing as pathetic as an aging hipster.	N
You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight.	N
Au contraire baby, you can't resist me.	Y
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.	N
You run the job, but I run the show.	N
Your wife told me no one would be killed.	N
There never was, and there never will be, another like you.	N
I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-	N
Peace and quiet is for libraries!	N
I - I don't know, Bill.	N
The bed looks like a dead animal act.	N
This you can't do in Times Square...	N
Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night!	Y
Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...	N
The atmosphere is very MacBeth-ish... what has, or is about to, happen?	N
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-	N
Real diamonds in a wig, the world we live in.	N
They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...	N
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?	N

Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.	N

Kids... always a disappointment.	N
See a family resemblance?	N
You tell *Her Majesty* that if her husband were here he'd tell her to get out of the house and get some air into her lungs.	Y
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.	N
No one should think themselves wiser than me!	Y
I will not give him up to them.	N

Billy wants to change, too, Clarice.	N
I graduated from UVa, Captain; it's not exactly a charm school.	N
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?	N
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT PAIN IS!	N

I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.	N
All's fair in love and basketball.	N
Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew.	N
I can't stand these things... it's like drinking coffee through a veil.	N
Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.	Y
It is infuriating that your unhappiness does not turn to fat!	N
When you start to eat like this something is the matter.	N
Do you know what these things cost over here?	N
It was our money and we want it back.	N
You're a hooker, you hooker.	N
Good luck on your important thing.	N
When it's ready, my body will just push it out.	N
I kept one of their menus last time we were here.	N

I never thanked you for saving my life.	N
Well, maybe you should just pray for shrimp.	Y
Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them.	N
Anyway, I guess you could say me and Momma was on our own.	N
That's all I have to say about that.	N
Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play.	N
Unicron, my master... with this, I shall make you my slave.	N
And soon we shall say the same of that infernal Unicron.	N
We've got to get a new travel agent.	N
Don't worry, I'm not coming after you.	Y
We can't hold out forever Kup, but we *can* give them one *humongous* repair bill.	N
Then we've got to trust in ourselves, and no matter what they odds, destroy Unicron.	Y
Why settle for a peek, Daniel, when you can see everything from "Lookout Mountain"?	N

That's what I ask and that's what I care about, get out of my office.	N
Stern, if this factory ever produces a shell that can actually be fired, I'll be very unhappy.	N
If you shoot without thinking, you go to prison and I get paid, that's how it works.	Y
You know, corporate accounting is sure as hell gonna notice $305,326.13, Michael!	N
Well, I didn't think you would sleep with a guy like Lumbergh!	N
What am I gonna do with 40 subscriptions to Vibe?	N
I'm going to take the blame for it, I decided.	N
Are you now, or have you ever been a homosexual?	N
Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?	N
You stay away from my wife, my life, my home, and my skunk!	Y
I know it's been a tough ordeal... with the trial and everything.	N
What are you, some kind of kung fu James Bond?	N
And even governments don't go to war with him.	N
I believe "shaved" is the expression.	N
I do like your dirty magazines.	N
God... let this be it.	N
You mean like, strip strip?	N
Now, do you know what a clitoris is?	N
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.	N
This one time, at band camp, I stuck a flute in my pussy.	N
We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?	N
Neither country proverb nor King's command could keep me from the woods, today.	N
No doubt they're as foul as the stuff you set on your table....	N
Mr. Hammond, the phones are working.	N
There's the Visitor's Center.	N
Jesus Christ, what happened?	N
Don't worry Jennie.	Y
I don't think you should tell her she doesn't have blood...	Y
It's too late in the game to be having these problems, David.	N
Glad to be weirdly close.	N
A minister addresses the mourners.	N
I don't know what I'm doing.	N
Well, we'll build it over time together.	N
My eyes still hurt from reading that movie.	N
Ronnie, come on baby, we gotta go.	Y
When it looked like they could get twenty-five years to life in prison just for skimming a casino, sick or no fuckin' sick you knew people were going to get clipped.	N
Now, that suitcase was goin' straight to one place: right to Kansas City ...which was as close to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go without gettin' themselves arrested.	N
What are you staring at you bald-headed Jew prick?	N
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay?	Y
Take this stiff and pound it up your fucking ass!	Y
Look at this, twenty fuckin' paints in a row.	N
Tell that fuckin' Pepe if he's switching stones on us, he'd better take a fucking camel back to Nigeria.	Y
I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?	N
Now, on top of everything else, I gotta make sure no one fucks around with the Golden Jew.	N
I mean, he was already in Vegas a couple of years and he had the fuckin' place clocked.	N
I want you to exit this guy off the premises, I want you to exit him off his feet and I want you to use his head to open the fucking door.	Y
Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.	N
If a guy fucking tripped over a banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.	N
...put Artie Piscano, the underboss of KC, in charge of making sure nobody skimmed the skim.	N
How the fuck can you grin?	N
What do I give a fuck?	N
You fucking mo-mo, what's the matter with you?	N
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.	Y
Take this one and stick it up your sister's ass!	Y
Boy, he really fucked himself up out here - - didn't he?	N
We are the luckiest sons of bitches in the world, you know that?	N
Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you.	N
So, you wanna go to a real party?	N
Well, right now my address is the RMS Titanic.	N
That's one of the good things about Paris: lots of girls willing to take their clothes off.	N
When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.	N
You shine up like a new penny.	N
Ain't you boys ever rowed before?	N
The last thing I need is another picture of me looking like a porcelain doll.	N
O hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea.	Y
Rose is displeased... what to do?	N
You wanted to see the propellers?	N
I saw that in a nickelodeon once and I always wanted to do it.	N
He died in the town he was born in, and never did see it.	N
You gonna cut her meat for her too there, Cal?	N
Hello girls, I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.	N
Come and get me, you son of a bitch!	Y
I'll be in to read you a story.	N
If I go any faster this thing will turn into a flying Cuisinart and we'll all be diced into oblivion!	N
Which means I have to go a lot of places to pay my debts and borrow money to keep it going....	N
I've always known I'll die alone.	N
What... Bones, what are we going to sing?	N
Please Captain, not in front of the Klingons.	Y
I believe I have found a faster way.	N
Why does God need a starship?	N
We'll play it your way.	N
Death to the demoness Allegra Geller!	N
Shall I clear all this away?	N
I suppose a smaller-caliber pistol would have to fire baby teeth.	N
As long as you have that, they know where you are.	N
Hang on, lads; I've got a great idea.	N
I'd like to check the cable modem first.	N
Oh, dear God, it's growing bigger!	N
The Batbook is pecking at his eyes!	N
Keep your damn filthy bones outta my mouth.	Y
I'm through bein' their garbage boy.	N
Well aren't you the sweetest little thing?	N
Then my lads, eternal life shall by ours!	N
I did not have to go as far as I was prepared to go, but I was prepared to go all the way.	N
Now, of all these parents you've told me about whose kids were killed, who would you consider to be good upstanding neighbors?	N
You'd make a good poker player, kid.	N
It was nice to see you again, Ally.	N
Damn you, Jack Sparrow...	N
There are no survivors.	N
My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.	N
I shall trade you the Compass, if you will help me... to find this.	N
Guard the boat, mind the tide... don't touch my dirt.	Y
Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor.	N
Every man has a price he will willingly accept, even for what he hoped never to sell.	N
Your authority as governor, your influence in London, and your loyalty to the East India Trading Company.	N
James Norrington, what has the world done to you?	N
Why don't you tell me what's happening?	Y
She's only a ship, mate.	N
Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger...!	N
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.	Y
The property you want that he possesses.	N
Jack Sparrow... Our debt is settled.	N
Who told them of the key?	N
You're not a tipsomaniac at your age?	N
You know that I can't tell you.	N
I feel like an idiot fainting in a stranger's office.	N
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.	N
I don't give a flying handshake what your name is.	N
Which is not a helluva lot to sink your teeth into.	N
In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.	N
You have taken your first step into a larger world.	N
I have a very bad feeling about this.	N
It sure is leaving in a big hurry.	N
Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease.	Y
I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.	N
And now, your highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base...	N
Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!	Y
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.	N
Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up...	N
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi; you're my only hope.	Y
There are still two more of them out there!	N
If there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.	N
Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!	N
One thing's for sure, we're all gonna be a lot thinner.	N
We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.	N
The Force is strong with this one.	N
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.	Y
There'll be no escape for the princess this time.	N
I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.	N
Where are you taking this... thing?	N
I'll have to clear it.	N
Your eyes can deceive you; don't trust them.	N
It'd be as well to let it go.	Y
I sense something; a presence I've not felt since...	N
Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.	N
I was at the Battle of Georgetown; I watched the White House burn to the ground!	N
You have been born again as soldiers in the army of the United Clans of Holn.	N
Tell me something: how much mail can a dead Postman deliver?	Y
If he could've that's what he would have said.	N
This is your daughter... her name is Hope.	N
So you can take us to St. Rose.	N
Wouldn't it be great if wars could be fought just by the assholes who started them?	N
I don't mean any disrespect, sir, but you'd be better off just letting me go.	N
Percy met your mouse.	N
Put these clothes on!	Y
I just can't see God putting a gift like that in the hands of a man who would kill a child.	N
You're going to have a few hours of quiet time now, so you can reflect on what you did to Del.	Y
Seeing a man die isn't enough for you, you gotta be close enough to smell his nuts cook?	N
Nothing's hurt so far but your pride...and nobody need ever know about that except the people in this room.	N
I guess sometimes the past just catches up with you, whether you want it to or not.	N
If it's something they can see with an X-ray, maybe it's something they can fix.	N
We each owe a death - there are no exceptions - but, oh God, sometimes the Green Mile seems so long.	N
I put you out front for Del, you put in your transfer to Briar Ridge the very next day.	N
Wipe your face before you get up Dean.	Y
John, I should have that just for now.	N
I am not now, nor have I ever been, a psychologist.	N
Even if it's just banging its head against a rock.	N
She kept yammering all the time, but her hips were doing all the talking.	N
I agree with you that you don't know what you're talking about.	N
I may be young, but Doc, I can tell you that I'm very immature.	N
The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.	N
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?	N
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.	N
Are you positive your mother's a bitch?	N
It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Cook.	N
I wish I could live in the shower.	N
I know it starts with a birth certificate...	N
How does it feel to know you're about to die?	N
We need that film and we don't need any bullshit --	N
Father, are you sure she's a supreme being?	N
Father, will you please explain what's going on?	N
Finger's gonna kill me.	N
I'm late as it is...	N
We don't take anything seriously, unless it's on a hard drive.	N
They found the weapon with Teddy's blood on it and their fingerprints.	N
It's a hard world for little things.	N
Bring them all down here to the kitchen.	Y
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.	N
No, Brother; I resigned only yesterday.	N
Child... You were looking for love, Ruby, in the only foolish way you knew how.	N
Ruby, I lost the love of my son -- I've found it with you all.	N
They abide, and they endure.	N
Mind where you shoot, boys!	Y
She'll be losing her mind to a tricky mouth and a full moon, and like as not, I'll be saddled with the consequences.	N
Whenever they do it's never nothing I want but something to show me how fancy and smart they've come up in the world.	N
Man of my age needs a little snort in the morning, heat the boilers.	N
This mornin' I was talkin' to this stranger up at the boardinghouse.	N
They've been shaking their ass for two minutes!	N
There are some days when I actually love it.	N
You didn't expect me to come down in my bathrobe, did you?	N
Apparently there must be a lot about show business I don't understand.	N
If your only faith is science, doctor, it may be you that's laid to rest.	N
Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.	N
Phillip, wake up... Have a nice stroll, asshole.	Y
NOBODY'S GONNA PUT ME TO SLEEP!	N
Let's snuff the sucka.	Y
You sure as shit did!	N
You stupid bitch, you're killing us... YOU'RE KILLING US.	N
After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing.	N
My enemy's enemy is a friend.	N
Why do you always watch that shit?	N
When somebody asks me a question, I tell them the answer.	N
I have to wade through a metre of water every morning.	N
I thought we'd be together only in death.	N
I sleep in a bed, not on the street.	N
The guide book was written by a bunch of lazy good-for-nothing Indian beggars!	N
This is the biggest dhobi ghat in the whole of India, Mister David.	N
Did he actually call himself "the talent"?	N
You put 'em on TV and - bam!	N
You gotta be kidding me.	N
Are you both from around here?	N
Good Lord, the little stoner's got a point.	N
We've had our people looking everywhere for Him.	N
I feel like I'm Han Solo, and you're Chewie, and she's Ben Kenobi, and we're in that fucked-up bar.	N
...and now you're telling me that I'm supposed to take you somewhere, and you don't even know where it is?	N
Your hard-on for smiting has prevented us from negotiating what should be the relatively simple matter of catching or staying on a bus.	N
And even though it was years ago, there's not a day that goes by that I don't wonder what went wrong.	N
Glick's the kind of asshole that would bless his own clubs for a better game.	N
Well, mine is a heritage Divine... and I wouldn't want to let down the family.	N
That's what you get, Mother fucker!	N
He had the knife at your throat.	N
So, Jay tells us you're gonna sleep with him.	N
If that's the case, then chick with him must be...	N
I am redefining weird on an hourly basis.	N
I lied to her last night, now this.	N
You know normally a patient wouldn't have a vat of Scotch during a session.	N
The young boy wants to replace his father so he can totally possess his mother.	N
Hey, why don't you look over that way before I bust you in your fuckin' head.	Y
You gonna stab me in the back like the piece of shit I always knew you were?	N
Dad has a patient who thinks he shits trout.	N
Are you going to read Grandpa's new book?	N
Time to close the door.	N
So who's the broad?	N
Death is only the beginning.	N
What's it look like!	N
I only gamble with my life, never my money.	N
Like I told ya, all I saw was sand.	N
Something's wrong with me.	N
How are my boys, Bill?	N
Don't let them in your mouth!	Y
Starla, get the hell out of here!	Y
Open the door, Jellybean	Y
You got school tomorrow.	N
Grant looks like a squid, don't know where he's gonna hide... Seaworld maybe.	N
And Wally and me, we also saw him that night, with mud all over his slacks.	N
Your gun is digging into my hip.	N
He broke out of a metal hospital.	N
If I'm not back in five minutes... just wait longer.	Y
As soon as I find the white pigeon, you're paid!	N
Good thing you're flexible enough to watch your own back... 'cause I ain't doing it no more.	N
This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?	N
I found a broken gasket from space.	N
Victor, this isn't the way to --	N
Yeah - I have that effect on people.	N
Oh, you remember my name do you?	N
Let's see if we can get blood from a stone.	N
We would have gone with The Rock, but it was taken.	N
You may wake up one day and find yourself extinct.	N
I'm interested in the antigens here, the agglutination reaction --	N
Wander off the beaten path, Doctor.	Y
I had to increase the dose.	N
You know, my mother used to say: A cold heart is a dead heart.	N
I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.	N
Well, this looks like the end of a terrible friendship.	N
All right, let's say we're in the door.	N
If there's one thing this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have it.	N
But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.	N
I eat the pussy, I eat the butt, I eat every motherfuckin' thang.	N
You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -	Y
We now return to Bullit already in progress.	N
You were chillin', kind of creepy even.	N
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice, right now.	N
I just don't think "nice" is a particularly interesting thing to be.	N
We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here, that way you won't be confused by their unexplainable presence in your home.	N
So we'll need you to go home and bring in everything you ever received from Clementine and anything that might remind you of her...	Y
It could have been - whole world - Willie Stark.	N
You know, Judge, dirt's a funny thing.	N
You throw money around like it was money.	N
He swept the old gang out of office.	N
Well, kiddo, I thought you outgrew superstition.	N
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles.	N
It's Halloween, everyone's entitled to one good scare.	N
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is?	N
I think I just came... didn't you feel it?	N
Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.	N
You are a wuss: part wimp, and part pussy.	N
You start from the second you walk into biology.	Y
Hope you had a hell of a piss, Arnold!	N
Well, that's not the way it works, really.	N
This is U.S. History, I see the globe right there.	N
You gotta dollar -- You're a friend of mine!	N
I'm not killing people... my future's in television.	N
So what's this money deal you were talking about?	N
Life was sweet... For a minute.	N
Head of network sales at thirty.	N
What kind of a man are you?	N
Yeah, well, you already know the story.	N
Sooner or later everyone needs a haircut.	N
How could I have been so stupid?	N
Every dog has his day.	N
Yeah, so did you, Bernstein.	N
Thank you, for summing that up	N
And straight out the back door.	N
Everything we know about you guys is wrong.	N
Wow, he's better than you ever were.	N
Chances of survival are dwindling into single-digits now...	N
Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims in its...	N
You are... a beautiful, beautiful, butterfly.	N
I've been monitoring their interaction.	N
She is severely fuckable, ain't she?	N
She is curious about this little transaction.	N
Do you think she woke up one morning and said: I think I'll go to law school today.	N
We're defending Brooke Windham, whose very wealthy husband was found shot to death in their Beacon Hill mansion.	N
Joey, have you ever been in a... in a Turkish prison?	N
Elaine, find out what the two sick people had for dinner.	Y
I'm a civilian, not a trout - you have no authority over me whatsoever.	N
And even if you were on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.	N
We, uh, trapped him with our chopper.	N
That it's about to go wrong.	N
You can fight a lot of enemies and survive, but not your biology.	N
Why don't you take my oil and I'll fucking pay you?	Y
The first and most important rule of gun-running is: Never get shot with your own merchandise.	Y
At least when they say they're going to have a war, they keep their word.	N
The second rule of gun-running is always ensure you have a foolproof way of getting paid.	Y
They are consuming small arms and ammunition and the cash register is well and truly ringing.	N
Yo wastoid, you're not gonna blaze up in here.	Y
How would I know, I mean he lies about everything anyway!	N
Chicks cannot hold their smoke, dat's what it is.	N
When I signed up, you know, for the course I mean.	N
Screws fall out all the time, the world is an imperfect place.	N
What're we s'posed to do if we hafta take a piss?	N
That man... is a brownie hound.	N
It makes it crawl back up!	N
Oh, obscene finger gestures from such a pristine girl.	N
You like your old man better than your mom?	N
Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?	N
You know what I got for Christmas this year?	N
Sometimes you just need the honesty and security of a whore.	Y
Because I can get into this vault in half an hour.	N
Come on up and watch TV.	N
That's what I am told.	N
Well, well, well, the Washington Redskin.	N
But I tell you what, Suit.	N
Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac.	N
I got her back for you.	N
I asked my girlfriend to marry me and she asked me to move out.	N
If you're around you should drop by and check out the new apartment.	Y
I guess you're not home.	N
You got me pretty fucking curious.	N
He went out the window... why would someone do that?	N
You stayed there five times in the past six months.	N
I'm gonna break your face!	N
Why don't you wait until morning.	N
We can't bury Shelly - S-She's a friend of ours.	N
What the hell are you doing down here, jerkin' off?	N
Do you think he'll ever kiss me again?	N
Great, because I haven't quite bankrupted us yet.	N
I can't believe I flew 10,000 miles for this shit!	N
Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!	Y
All he wanted was some Mushu.	N
I can get to Ricky Tan.	N
I'm gonna give you an L.A.P.D ass-whuppin'!	N
No, don't do that, I had a big lunch.	N
I think someone better call the police.	N
Don't worry, the plates are safe.	N
The appearance of law must be upheld, especially when it's being broken.	N
It's not the sort of responsibility the founding fathers might have recognized.	N
I come for my due and proper.	N
It's the young Vallon, is it?	N
Is the colonel's underwear a matter of national security?	N
Santiago wasn't going anywhere, isn't that right, Colonel.	N
Oh, spare me the psychobabble father bullshit.	Y
We'll work out of my apartment.	N
So this is what a courtroom looks like.	N
Their fate was sealed the moment Santiago died.	N
Maybe, if we work at it, we can get Dawson charged with the Kennedy assassination.	N
Thank you for playing "Should We or Should-We-Not Follow the Advice of the Galacticly Stupid".	N
Whatever happened to saluting an officer when he leaves the room?	N
Dawson's gonna go to jail just to spite me.	N
We do not negotiate with terrorists!	N
Can I offer you a drink?	N
In a world where the dead are returning to life, the word "trouble" loses much of its meaning.	N
I could send five hundred men against that thing and they'd all come back in body bags.	N
What happened, Riley, did you get fucked?	N
I like the iron I already got.	N
I don't usually need that many.	N
Gotta go get the keys, Riley.	N
OK, brother, then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.	Y
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.	Y
I don't know WHAT he was, but he made Frankenstein look like a lily!	N
Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.	Y
The Vietnam War was fought over a bet that Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onassis.	N
Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.	N
This guy's a restraining order waiting to happen.	N
That I won't be back for two weeks.	N
I am an American citizen, and I demand to see Alice Sutton.	N
You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.	N
If you could remember who stabbed you with the wheelchair, and where it happened it would really help.	N
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.	N
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe... it's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.	N
Like running into a liquor store with a .357 magnum in your hand, feeling the adrenalin pumping through your veins.	N
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?	N
What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?	N
The issue isn't whether you're paranoid, but whether you're paranoid enough.	N
So there's no information on the street, which is how cases get made.	N
Paranoia is just reality on a finer scale.	N
I already got everything I need from you.	N
Look... everyone needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometimes, it's what we are.	N
Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.	N
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she is giving head.	N
I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.	N
Oooh... a little B&E action.	N
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.	Y
Jesus Lenny, you scared the fuck out of me!	N
I was trying to keep you out of this.	N
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals.	N
So, if you'll do me a favor and let me the fuck out of here...	Y
I don't fucking know how to pray.	N
I just... we're running a little late.	N
Mrs. Robinson, if you don't mind my saying so, this conversation is getting a little strange.	N
Excuse me - I think I'd just like to check something on the car for a minute -	N
Do you need any gas, Father?	N
Six blocks up - three blocks over.	N
Welcome to the desert of the real.	N
This is Chicago as it exists today.	N
Find them and destroy them	Y
Can you hear me, Morpheus?	N
Welcome to the real world.	N
You know what real is?	N
Nothing that a bottle of Jack and a straight razor won't fix.	N
And I think I stole that from the back of an in-flight magazine.	N
Mom, this is so not the time to be yourself.	Y
Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!	N
I look like a total wanker, don't I?	N
I hear that make-up sex is the best kind.	N
Oh sweet Jesus, who gave that woman an amp?	N
She must have drowned her rules in the Chardonnay.	N
I'd rather fight with you than make love with anyone else.	N
That everybody knew and no one respected you enough to tell you?	N
Let me teach you a trick: if you look people in the eye, they won't notice what you're wearing.	Y
And then, I was going to get out of here and leave you alone, but halfway to the station, I realized--	N
Do you think you are the only one who feels anything?	N
Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.	N
You speak so many bloody languages, and you never want to talk.	N
He was shouting - I love you, Katharine, I love you so much.	N
There is no God, but I hope someone watches over you.	N
You know - the hollow - here - does that have an official name?	N
If you live another day I will be very impressed.	N
Look, you gave me some work over the last year.	N
You are in a position unsuitable to give orders.	N
But I don't believe you would kill yourself!	N
Too much to drink, Dr. Jones?	N
No -- don't you see -- crawling --	N
That's either the creepiest... or the sweetest thing I have ever heard.	N

He won't let them go!	N
Nothing, if you leave right now.	N
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.	N
You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.	Y
Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.	N
Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?	N
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.	N
Rick, we are to have an important guest tonight, Major Strasser of the Third Reich, no less.	N

We're not gonna have a war, we're gonna have the appearance of a war.	N
It's gotta be quick, it's gotta be dramatic, you got to have an enemy.	Y
I just bet my balls and shook on it.	N
I'm going to see what the hell happened.	N
A strange wang right in my palm.	N
I've seen another man's diddly.	N
To girls with big tits!	N
Where's the women, man?	N
I just cannot believe any of this voodoo bullshit!	N
Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?	N
Anybody touches me, and we go!	N
So help me I mean it!	Y
Maybe we're at war with Norway?	N
Bet the last place you ever go.	Y
It's not contaminated, you don't even know what that word means.	N
What if Bo's baby monitor is picking up signals from the extraterrestrials?	N
It's like War of the Worlds.	N
I'm sorry, what book is this?	N
See this is why we're not watching TV, people become obsessed.	N
Even entertaining the possibility of this for a minute has been exciting.	N
Have you checked the children?	N
You've called the police?	N
I'll torture you so slowly, you'll think it's a career.	Y
I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....	N
Is looking like a constipated warthog a prerequisite for getting a job in the art world?	N
I'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride.	N
Did anything about that seem unusual to you?	N
Gives her time to get the wrong impression.	N
Unlimited technology from the whole universe, and we cruise 'round in a Ford P.O.S.	N
Maybe you're a badass in your hive, but this is New York City.	N
We'll take it from here.	N
Maybe you won't have to.	N

You're gonna go in the Denny's restaurant and stay there.	Y
You know, Phillip, you have a goddamned red, white and blue American right to eat cotton candy and ride roller coasters.	Y

I need me a time machine with a loud radio to take me where I'm going.	N
'Dear Robert, I just wanted to tell you that me leaving has nothing to do with you.	N
Sure don't look none too prosperous.	N
Don't matter what kin' either.	N
Takes no nerve to do something, ain't nothin' else you can do.	N
Uncle John don't talk much but when he does he shore talks sense.	N
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"?	N
That's right, Stud, hold me down.	Y
Second date, no tongue!	Y
I hope that hurt.	N
Hell will hold no surprises for us.	N
What did they do to your eyes?	N
You killed my father, your ass is mine!	N
But -- -- she'll take care of you, Myers.	N
I'm fireproof, you're not.	N
Tell Father I'll be home.	Y
Then you are like us; your home is here.	N
It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.	N
The war will still be here tomorrow.	N
What will you do after the war?	N
I'm gonna go get Ted, just don't fall apart on me now!	Y
Also, we're heading right for the sun and can't seem to change course.	N
And then, Black Beauty couldn't take it any longer and he finally did some of his own mounting.	N
No, it's these... fucking queers on blades that can't accept a fucking pass to save their lives!	N
Since you like chicks, right, do you just look at yourself naked in the mirror all the time?	N
She does this big ol' pelvic thrust - cracks my tooth in half, sends it down my throat.	N
Archie is *not* fucking Mr. Weatherbee!	N

My dad, brothers, uncles -- we all drink and sooner or later we all fuck up.	N
Godfather has more eyes than a pineapple!	N
We must stand by him as one.	Y
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.	N

You kiss by the book.	N
O, be some other name!	N
I will bite my thumb at them, which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.	N
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maiden heads, take it in what sense thou wilt.	Y
Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man.	Y
And thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but discords.	Y
I've come for you, Margaret.	N
Not till I'm dead, Eric.	N
Do you want to be dead Albert?	N
Or do we piss about all day?	N
Who do you think you're fuckin' with?	N
Why should I give house- room to your sort?	N
Take your clothes off.	Y
Keep your pants on.	Y
You couldn't run an egg and spoon race Eric.	N
I bet you could use a drink, could you, Eric?	N
I thought you were dead, asshole.	N
But, Dr. Hudgens, I was just...	N
This doesn't make any sense.	N
I think we'd better run...	N
If it bleeds, we can kill it.	N
Billy, take the radio, leave the rest.	N
She says the jungle... it just came alive and took him.	N
I should've wasted the bitch when I had the chance.	N
That's a real nasty habit you got there.	N
I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?	N
Is he always this funny, or only on days when he's wanted for murder?	N
I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.	N
The Red Soxs are always winning, until they lose.	N
I don't know if I can say that.	N
The first step is love, the second is mercy.	Y
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients.	Y
Ever notice people who see shit are always crazy?	N
I make her wait and it drives her crazy.	N
I'd always had nightmares, but now the ghosts didn't wait for me to sleep.	N
The last month belonged to Rose, but there were a hundred more ready to come out.	N
Don't make me take off my sunglasses!	Y
Your friend there just untied the water beggar.	N
I'd rather die than to stay away from you.	N
To get to the other side, and 1 point 772453851.	N
Maybe he'll adopt me.	N
We left you a message.	N
Wow, that is one ugly dude.	N
Yeah, what did we do, Ray?	N
Viggy, Viggy, Viggy, you have been a bad monkey!	N
I'll keep to the middle of the channel.	N
Let's see what happens when we take away the puppy.	N
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.	N
The needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.	N
I know this will come as a pleasant surprise for you...	N
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and have a heart attack.	N
We're on our feet now, and now we're gonna talk out to the car.	N
My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.	Y
Then why don't you tell my boy here Vince, where you got the shit hid.	Y
Mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with?	N
Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: you're Brett, right?	N
If my answers frighten you then you should cease asking scary questions.	Y
Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant.	N
Hey, you won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of me personality, will you madam?	Y
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.	Y
I'm going out parading before it's too late!	N
Well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.	Y
There you go, hiding behind a smokescreen of bourgeois cliches.	N
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.	N
Sorry we hurt your field, mister.	N
Ever seen one of these before?	N
I now declare this bridge open!	N
Aye, but you know him well.	N
Nice building... bad roof... goooood parking.	N
I'm going down to relax.	N
What's the good of being a ghost if you can't frighten people away.	N
With all these historical landmarks in town, where are they going to put the condominiums?	N
Go ahead... make my millenium.	Y
This burg got a cathouse?	N
Number fifty-four million six hundred and one... Ferndoch.	N
You don't have an appointment, do you?	N
I'm not an enigma, just a contradiction.	N
He suddenly wanted to be rid of it.	N
Hang on tightly, let go lightly.	Y
But his father was a gambler.	N
Welcome back Jack, to the house of addiction.	N
Jack knew it still wasn't quite right...	N
I understand if you don't, but I hope that you do.	N
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.	N
Without hope there's no point to anything.	N
He doesn't give a shit about anyone.	N
I love you, but I should have never married you.	N
Why'd you have to get us into this, Foxy?	N
He didn't take the money.	N
it's what I always wanted!	N
To the top of Mount Wanna-hock-a-loogie.	N
He's gonna get outta here!	N
I'm having fish tonight.	N
Just start with your name.	Y
You think you can do these things, but you just can't, Nemo.	Y
Just stop trying to speak whale, you're gonna make things worse.	Y
All drains lead to the ocean.	N
Okay, you gotta be quick.	Y
I didn't come this far to be breakfast.	N
No, but the boat has to be here somewhere!	N
My oath of celibacy is on record, Captain.	N
or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?	N
We all create God in our own image.	N
All ship's functions going to automatic, Captain.	N
Open the doors, and tell the world the truth.	Y
I was orphaned when I was nine years old.	N
Have you come to make a martyr out of me?	N
The fool thought he had duplicated the moment of creation.	N
Religion is flawed because man is flawed.	N
It's said he was a doctor.	N
There are some mistakes you cannot risk when you have children.	Y
You know, I always think about when you...Oh, there's no point.	N
Lately, your low self-esteem is just good common sense.	N
Hell, I don't mind driving her at night.	N
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and so inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?	N
We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.	N
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower!	Y
We have monitored a large explosion in your sector.	N
There is an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.	N
We believe it was caused by over mining and insufficient safety precautions.	N
Why, that cunning little Vulcan!	N
Now there's a poser.	N
Bet you wished you'd stood in bed!	N
What do you think YOU'VE been doing?	N
Guess who's coming to dinner.	N
Captain, shall we raise our shields?	N
Here's to swimmin' with bow-legged women.	N
Nobody tells me how to run my property.	Y
My husband tells me you're in sharks.	N
Excuse me, but what are you talking about?	N
I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.	N
After this is over, they'll make me into a Goddamned hero.	N
Sucking the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone.	N
If you noticed, everyone started off with their own stride, their own pace.	N
If I don't ask him, at least I won't be disobeying him.	N
The meetings will be conducted by myself and the other new initiates now present.	N
You're not someone I could get interested in, Craig, you play with dolls.	N
" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute.	N
Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.	N
I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.	N
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man.	Y
I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.	N
What happens when a man goes through his own portal?	N
I moved his arm across your girlfriend's glorious tit.	N
Truth is for suckers, Johnny Boy.	N
This is my type of chick.	N
Shoulda, woulda, coulda, pal.	N
Wish I could, Gordy.	N
Now move, honky, before I cut your white ass.	Y
Did that chickenshit asshole Raphael send you here, boy?	N
I hope, for your sake, that you were initiating a mating ritual.	N
I don't know... he bathed... now he is roaming the ship.	N
Least I could do for the captain of the enterprise.	N
and every time it scared the hell out of me.	N
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.	Y
But that wasn't so long ago... it couldn't have been more than...	N
Only one is a wanderer; two together are always going somewhere.	N
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?	N
One final thing I have to do... and then I'll be free of the past.	N
If your husband is awake, say you couldn't sleep and went out for some air.	Y
There's an old saying: Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer.	Y
They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.	N
Well, you didn't think I forgot about you, did you?	N
One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.	N
Come D'Artagnan, we're saving the King!	N
His name is the Count De Rochefort.	N
There was a time when I would have given my life for a kind word from you.	N
However, if you would like to entertain me with a story, I'm eager to hear it.	N
You should have heard your brother squeal when I broke his fucking neck.	N
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life?	N
Just remember that when you sign for the tip.	N
I'll pull into the parking garage and wait.	N
C'mon baby, come ta' papa, I'll kiss ya' fuckin' dalmatian.	Y
Tell me you heard the shot and you're calling the police right now...	Y
No one kills him but me!	Y
I want blood for my blood.	N
Welcome to the party, pal.	N
Bad for your health anyway.	N
Nine million terrorists in the world and I gotta kill one with feet smaller than my sister.	N
After I get my foot out of my mouth, we'll really be cooking, and then I can --	N
Nothing is permanent, not even death.	N
But your sacrifice must be pure.	Y
You picked the wrong day not to use the ATM.	N
We don't want another Pearl Street Bridge, do we?	N
The number one fear of people isn't dying, it's public speaking.	N
I want to know everyone you've met for the last twenty years.	Y
I sell a product that's better than the competition at a price that's less than the competition.	N
So if that dope doesn't arrive, for whatever reason - Cousin or no cousin - don't let me down.	Y
Even a fool gets to be young once.	N
I haven't talked to them in years.	N
The most important thing in business is honesty, integrity, hardwork... family... never forgetting where we came from.	Y
Though I'd rather not have to drag my ass all the way up here every time.	N
I started playing baseball when I was a kid like everybody else but better than everybody else.	N
The broads're probably lining up right now, waiting for ol' Ty and his buddy Stump.	N
Know ye that a prince and a great man has fallen this day.	Y
Or... there's the kind with one great subject that consumes them forever.	N
I'm not sure I agree with you a hundred percent on your police work, there, Lou.	N
Now, I saw some rough stuff on your priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide...	N
Ah, hon, ya got Arby's all over me.	N
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.	N
OK, so we got a trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, these folks drive by, there's a high-speed pursuit, ends here and then this execution-type deal.	N
I had to do a few things in the Twin Cities, so I thought I'd check in with ya about that USIF search on Shep Proudfoot... Oh, yah?...	N

The White House is the single greatest home court advantage in the modern world.	N
Sydney, seldom does a day go by that I'm not burned in effigy.	N
Seven trillion dollar communications system at my disposal, and I can't find out if the Packers won.	N
Sydney, I can't challenge the school bully to a fight just because he picked on my girlfriend.	N
If anyone needs me, I'll be in the Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen.	N
If my friend Andy Shepherd had shown up, I would have liked that campaign.	N
Sydney, Congress doesn't take this long.	N
You know, I'm a little nervous.	N
Did you drink and dial?	N
These girls want to party.	N
Quaffable, but uh... far from transcendent.	N
You drop this bombshell on me.	N
You don't understand my plight.	N
Took her forever to find them.	N
You're getting *married* on Saturday?	N
Oh, just that he loves her.	N
Behold, as a wild ass in the desert, go I forth to my work.	N

Now all you gotta do is pull the trigger mister.	Y
"Jim," I says, "You are a liar and a horse thief.	N
Did Pa used to kill folks?	N
I think they got the fever.	N
You know how women lie.	N
What's all that wood?	N
I suppose you know, Bob, if I ever see you again I'm just going to start shooting and figure it was self-defense.	N
Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.	N
That was not Mozart laughing, Father... that was God.	N
And in spite of me, a wonder was revealed.	N
What's so intelligent about writing a Requiem Mass?	N
I'm paying people just to wait for you.	N
That doesn't really work, does it?	N
It is already here in my head.	N
Is that woman still lying on the floor?	N
At last I shall be freed by death!	N
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat!	N
And how will you make him keep it?	N
A young man trying to impress beyond his abilities.	N
Taking out what you should never have put in.	N
Well, isn't this a good opportunity to... slip her one?	N
If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.	N
Bugger this for a bunch of bananas.	N
You think it's the wrong moment.	N
If I were to employ a wet rag would I have to pay it as much as I pay you?	N

It gets easier, doesn't it Frank?	N
I need to see you right away.	Y
You are in the courtroom of world opinion and you can answer yes or no.	N
But today, again, if I heard you correctly, you now say they do not exist.	N
We were eyeball to eyeball and I think the other fella just blinked.	N
Mr. President, agreeing to such a trade would be tantamount to paying ransom.	N
I'll whistle up some luck for you.	N
We need to be positive before we react.	Y
Those goddamn Kennedys are gonna destroy this country if we don't do something about this!	Y
The Big Red Dog is digging in our back yard, and we're justified in shooting him.	N
Sleep is for the weak Mr. President.	N
Feels good to win, doesn't it?	N
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.	N
And we need to get these guys out of the White House.	N
Well, gentlemen, if anybody's got any great ideas, now's the time.	Y
How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?	N
Does my inner child need a spanking?	N
There's a glitch in my swing.	N
Greatness courts failure.	Y
Now wait, Doreen.	Y

No-one has ever attempted a double bypass brain transplant before.	N
I've always wanted to put a spaceman into orbit.	N

Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.	Y
I think you've had enough tea for today, let's get you outta here, Buzz.	Y
Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.	Y
Look at him, perverse as a pink pickle.	N
In the morning we'll plan our fight.	N
Kids - 10 seconds of joy, 30 years of misery.	Y
I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.	N
Duck, or you're gonna be talkin' out yo ass!	Y
Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...	N
No Brain, no pain... think about it.	Y
Do you understand these rights, Drew buddy?	N
We can stay up late, swapping manly stories, and in the morning, I'm making waffles!	N
I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time.	N
Sure, it's big enough... but look at the location!	N

This guy's got his hands on the table.	N
You can't audit life, my friend.	Y
Will you do it for me Carl?	N
I can't believe I tripped like that.	N
Let's go to some place with class.	Y
Thus with a kiss I die.	N
A dateless bargain, to engrossing death.	N
He was alive when I buried him.	N
...I'll get out of your way.	N
Let's do it outside, in nature.	Y
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.	N
Who looks stupid now?	N
This kind of murder...	N
I swear I will not kill anyone.	N
That is one of my mission parameters.	N
So, what's your story?	N
You can't cry, John.	Y

Well, I'll be a monkey's bare-assed uncle.	N
They're not gonna get away this time.	N
Cut it out butt-hole!	Y
Yeah, turn it up!	Y
Why does everybody want to see my schlong?	N
Where I come from there is no T.P.	N
This is the coolest thing I have ever seen.	N
They need to put a drinking fountain out here.	N
Maybe I left my sense of humor in my other suit.	N
Except, if you'll excuse me, I'm not in jail.	N
I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.	N
My curiosity is killing me; what are you so rambunctious about tonight?	N
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels!	N
Put the whip down and I might respect what you're saying...	Y
Watch me run a 50-yard dash with my legs cut off!	Y
I'm nice to people where it pays me to be.	N
Don't remove the gangplank, Sidney - you may wanna get back onboard.	Y
She'll be fast asleep in five minutes, loaded with those headache pills...	N
Tell me sir, when he dies, do you think he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?	N
Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?	N
Everybody knows Manny Davis - except Mrs. Manny Davis.	N
It's the charming street urchin's face.	N
Who could love a man who makes you jump into hoops like a trained poodle?	N
He never would have killed himself if I hadn't gone through with the annulment.	N
Now don't kid a kidder.	Y
Yes, the Justice, that's right.	N
I love this dirty town.	N
Say hello to Sidney Falco.	N
The next time you want information, don't scratch for it like a dog, ask for it like a man!	Y
I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop.	N
Son, I don't relish shooting a mosquito with an elephant gun, so why don't you just shuffle along?	Y
You see, Dallas, a plague on both our houses... We may have to call this game on account of darkness...	N
Sidney, this syrup you're giving out with... you pour over waffles, not J.J. Hunsecker.	Y
Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here!	N
This is the first time I've seen you lucid.	N
You only killed your stepfather as far as I know.	N
I wish, for just one day, Dad couldn't tell a lie.	N
.If I go in the water right after lunch, will I drown?	N
Do you see any family resemblance?	N
Highest lead density on the market.	N
That's the last time I leave you in charge.	N
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.	N
Now you're John Hammond.	Y
Where does it say that?	N
If John Doe's head splits open and a UFO should fly out, I want you to have expected it.	Y
But, if you decide to have the baby, then, at that very instant, when you're absolutely sure... tell him.	Y
It's impressive to see a man feeding off his emotions.	N
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.	N
This isn't going to have a happy ending.	N
No human being could do these horrible things, right?!	N
Discovering the object of the game *is* the object of the game.	Y
I don't know, out of boredom, to get back at me--	N
We've met before, haven't we?	N
In fact, I'm there right now.	N
I'm voting for Dukakis.	N
I'm going to Harvard.	N
Some people are just born with tragedy in their blood.	N
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.	N
I promise, that one day, everything's going to be better for you.	N
I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.	N
"No duh" is a product of fear.	Y
There's no need to be embarrassed.	Y
Is that all the gusta you can musta?	N
And so, let us begin Lifeline Exercise No.	N
Hey, porky pig, I hope you get molested.	N
We get to go home at 7:55.	N
Go Back to China, bitch.	Y
Hey, Cherita... want a cigarette?	N
No offence, Professor Tripp, but you look kinda crappy.	N
Can I--I mean--do you mind--if I wear this again.	N
You take yourself out of the game, you start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream and of course it's going to end up on the friendship tip.	N
Bring a James Bond for me and my boy Mikey, and if you tell the bartender to go easy on the water... ...this Kennedy has your name on it.	Y
They went with someone who had more theme-park experience.	N
See, it's all how you look at it.	N
This place is dead anyways.	N
That was pretty cold, dude.	N
You're so money and you don't even know it!	N
But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said.	N
If we split up, I'm going with you guys.	N
Well, I think we should start searching for your son.	N
Reverse Darwinism - survival of the most idiotic.	N
That's the nice thing about them.	N
On this island there is no such thing as safe.	N
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise!	N
Fine, go ahead and scream and when that "Tricikloplots" attacks you, don't come crying to me.	Y
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?	N
This is what my people died for... the right to make a movie in this town.	N
The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.	N
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.	N
I did...and we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you.	N
Only second chance I know, is the chance to make the same mistake twice.	N
I'm just here to do a job, just like the rest of these...	N
Everybody needs a hobby.	N
No, you're absolutely...	N
I think I'm gonna choke on feel good.	N
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?	N
Tell me, big shot, how you gonna write a book about something you know nothing about?	N
And just what exactly are the Chinese doing here in the middle of the American desert anyway?...	N
I like your hair 'cause it's short.	N
We shouldn't be doin' this, Early.	N
Is it just me, or did this trip go downhill since we ran out of Lucky lager.	N
Hate to be an Indian-giver but I'm gonna have to ask for my gun back.	N
Look, I don't know shit about shit but I know right from wrong!	N
A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.	N
If you could take a dump sometime in this century, then we could go home where it's warm.	Y
Bowlers do it in an alley?...Non profit lawyers do it for free... what is it with these people?	N
Because you thought I was *cocky*, I'm now on a permanent *acid trip*?	N
We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.	N
You didn't tell me you could sing like that!	N
But, wait-- Tess-- that's always been Nikki's number.	N
That's the way it crumbles... cookie-wise.	N
What did you do with the cards?	N
Why do people have to love people anyway?	N
Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?	N
Premium-wise and billing-wise, we are eighteen percent ahead of last year, October-wise.	N
Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.	N
Just because I wear a uniform doesn't make me a girl scout.	N
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it.	N
'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house, not a creature was stirring... nothin'... no action... dullsville!	N
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana -- -- want to see his picture?	N
I'd like to spell it out for you... only I can't spell!	N
The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.	N
You wanna play "hide the salami" with his old lady?	N
Could have got two-and-a-half to five, but they wouldn't prosecute.	N
Mister, you got a lot to learn about people.	Y
They've got a little place south of Silverado.	N
You used to ride with that guy?	N
I wish you the best, Mrs. Parker.	N
Now, I don't wanna kill you, and you don't wanna be dead.	Y
I haven't had a drink of whiskey or slept in a bed for ten days.	N
Shut it... lock it... and get the fuck away from it.	Y
She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!	N
Please don't do anything stupid.	Y
Can't get in the room.	N
The people who hire me, they don't have to be convinced to save their own lives.	N
I've spent a lot of time learning not to react to things like other people do.	N
They don't wash cars on the upper level.	N
I thought I might hole up with my dad.	N
So... you, uh, ladies liking the angle of the dangle?	N
I'm supposed to install a firewall on his system-	N
You're some sort of big, fat, smart-bug, aren't you?	N
Yeah, if I live through this, they'll probably hang me.	N
I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill 'em all!	N
Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.	N
C'mon, who's the greatest cocksucker in the whole world?	N
shoulders tonguing his -- Just get me out of here, baby.	Y
He's got you on a pedestal and me in his arms.	N
That's just the sort of thing my father and I discussed.	N
When we get back, we have GOT to try this in the simulator...	N
Jesus, Jim -- if we don't make it -- if we miss the REMO...	N
I'm not Josie Grossie anymore!	N
It was a long time ago -	N
Oh my God, like, there goes another lemming!	N
Last I checked--this was still a free country.	N
You of all people should know Terry, in your hotel, there's always someone watching.	N
See, the kind of people you steal things from, they have insurance to compensate them.	N
Did someone call for a doctor?	N
That how you gonna stand?	N
My lady, the tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you.	N
Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune.	Y
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.	N
Will you read it for me?	N
I'm a dead man and buggered to boot!	N
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.	N
Gentlemen upstage; ladies downstage... Are you a lady Mr. Kent?	N
"Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!	N
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.	N
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.	N
Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we shall send you back to Stratford to your wife!	Y
Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.	Y
She provides the *whole* southwest with chicken feed!	N
Edith was just telling me about her job.	N
During war time, the national suicide rate goes down.	N
Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.	N
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.	N
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.	N
Grab the shovel, Harold.	Y
Because if you are...	N
You can't think on your feet, you oughta keep your mouth closed.	Y
I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.	N
You've got a big mouth... now I'm gonna show you an even bigger one.	N
You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.	N
Cop couldn't find his dick, two hands and a map.	N
Hey, I don't want to hear your fucking war stories...	N
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.	N
The cops tell the eyewitnesses, "Don't doubt your ID, we got 'em dead on the gun.	N
The last struggle for Constitutional rights is being waged over drugs.	N
Aren't we saying cocaine is more potent than our Constitution?	N
Well, let's not drag the constitution into this.	Y
So what've you been up to since then?	N
You know, I haven't gotten stoned once since the trial started.	N
Repeat drunk drivers, and I'm gonna get 'em all off.	N
I looked for you in my closet tonight.	N
I've gotta go to sleep now.	N
Why are there people like Frank?	N
I got all this information illegally.	N
Don't you fucking look at me!	Y
What did you hear on the phone .	N
He put his disease in me.	N
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.	N
Do you like the way I feel?	N
You can kiss them if you want.	N
Night time is the right time.	N
Come on, it's grad night.	N
Just use the combos, and keep the feet light...	Y
We can't let those gang-bangers get away, man...	N
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.	Y
Your father was looking for you, Mr. Robertson.	N
Go ahead... take your best shot, motherfucker!	Y
God damn, we're in New York!	N
Please don't give him any more acid.	Y
And not that anybody's using you, but -	N
Look at this: an entire generation of Cinderellas and there's no glass slipper.	N
And you skipped kindergarten because I taught it to you when you were four.	N
Adolescence is a marketing tool.	N
So you skipped fifth grade.	N
I never said I was a golden god... or did I?	N
What gives you the right to get this personal with me.	N
When and where does this "real world" occur?	N
I'm a friend of Penny Lane's.	N
He was never a person, he was a journalist!	N
And I'm still in love with you Leslie.	N
Just think, any other city in the world and you'd still be a virgin.	Y
Something about that girl brought out the best in a lot of... ... pretty average people.	N
Does anybody remember laughter?	N
Let's not reminisce.	N
Listen to Tommy with a candle burning, and you'll see your entire future.	Y
And when he rebels in some strange and odd way, don't blame me.	N
I'm never as good as when you're there.	N
I'm not famous.... but you could always use me.	N
Who would like to buy some aspirin?	N
I'll start by following the shoreline.	N
Doctor, would an ape make a human doll that TALKS?	N
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.	Y
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.	N
I can't hurt them... but I threaten them somehow.	N
Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.	N
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.	Y
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.	N
Eileen -- I didn't know you were that kinda girl!	N
Half of writing history is hiding the truth.	N
Mal shoots him in the head, turns back.	N
What're we expectin' to find here that equals the worth of a turd?	N
He never belonged here, and his sister's no saner than one of them Reavers.	N
Boy, it sure would be nice if we had some grenades, don't you think?	N
She goes woolly again, we're gonna have to put a bullet to her.	N
Eta Kooram Nah Smech!	N
May I see her?	N
Dear Buddha, please bring me a pony and a plastic rocket...	Y
I didn't look through the... stuff... just sundries I expect.	N
Well, something sure the hell ain't right.	N
See how the inevitable mutiny is coming along.	N
I am a leaf on the wind - watch how I soar.	Y
140 Long as that landing strip is made of fluffy pillows...	N
I don't care what you believe in, just believe in it.	Y
It's for the men River might have killed in that bar.	N
I've never credited the Alliance with an overabundance of brains and if you're the best they've got...	N
And the 40 only reason you're talking such a lot is you can't get a fix on us.	N
...that your ransom video already has 47,000 hits on YouTube.	N
We didn't even know she had been taken hostage.	N
Take off your shirt, and I'll tell you all about it.	Y
I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.	N
He's never met a princess - only queens.	N
My gardener, who insisted I bring him today.	N
One likes to live simply.	N
I expect you can't.	N
You must think the whole world is queer.	Y
I don't like to talk about that.	N
Come here, damn you, I want to touch you.	Y
Maybe they were once, but they're not now.	N
We'll tear your soul apart!	Y
It's time we were away.	N
We had to hear it from your own lips.	N
If he takes another step, we open his throat.	N
Why is it I can't get it on with the good guys?	N
Why do millions of people have to die for this...Crime of  the Century?	N
I wonder what they're wearing in Addis Ababa?	N
Did you ever try to run in high heels?	N
Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack.	N
Will you save my mother first?	N
It's amazing that brain can generate enough power to keep those legs moving.	N
I just knew you couldn't resist the chance of sort of ... pitch in.	N
This maniac should be wearing a number, not a badge.	N
Your English is getting good... You're showing it off.	N
My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled by the heathen.	N
We must sue for a truce, and buy him off.	N
Every man dies, not every man really lives.	N
I want a home and children and peace.	N
Before we let you leave, your commander must cross that field, present himself before this army, put his head between his legs, and kiss his own arse.	Y
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.	N
We all end up dead, it's just a question of how and why.	N
We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord.	N
They look at us like we're monsters.	N
Tell him I couldn't read his lips.	Y
My grandfather... was a very... SICK... man.	N
How long will this whole thing take?	N
He killed the man who set you free.	N
Have you -- how does one meet the Emperor?	N
Today I saw a slave become more powerful than the Emperor of Rome.	N
They are my children and all I want to do is love them.	N
If only you had been born a man, what a Caesar you would have made.	N
Well, pretend to be my loving daughter tonight and walk with me to my chamber.	Y
Even a broken clock is right twice a day.	N
I guess I should call him as a rebuttal	N
Is it safe to say that the person who inflicted this wound intended to kill?	N
And I think I've already found about six disqualifiers in Delaware, Ohio, and Florida.	N
Don't be afraid of it, Daddy.	Y
The infant looks at her older brother.	N
Why don't you just lick 'em when they walk by?	N
She thought she was gonna be a big movie star.	N
You know you're on the path to truth when you smell shit, isn't that what they say?	Y
That's OK, I'm not looking for a proctologist or a urologist I'm looking for Sargeant Barlow.	N
Didn't think I'd get to see anybody get shot in this war.	N
And I'd gladly stand up; next to you and defend her still today.	N
Don't make me smoke your ass, Abdul!	Y
We are here for your protection and safety.	N
What have you done with his body?	N
My husband's dead, isn't he?	N
You touch my sister again, I'll kill you.	N
Make your kid a orphan before he's born.	N
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothin'.	N
Buddy, this is a private party.	N
Paulie, pull over, I gotta take a leak.	Y
He's already thinking of going to the mattresses.	N
It's safer to teach you English!	N
I'll be leaving in ten minutes.	N
Now all we need... is skin.	N
I think it's still here.	N
Nothing personal, babe!	N
Oh, poor Larry.	N
Sure is a funky old house, ain't it?	N
Oh, I think we're going to have several.	N
Guess old Melissa found what she was looking for.	N
It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy.	N
There's been a murder almost everyplace in this house!	N
I think I'll do what I damn well please.	N
What good is a million dollars when you're dead?	N
Now we know how the guest list was made up.	N
He's a VH1 documentary without the music.	N
My playpen used to be in her studio.	N
When I speak of time, I'm speaking of the fourth dimension.	N
We can move in the other three -- up, down, forward, backward, sideways.	N
When I want your opinion, I'll beat it out of you.	Y
Pompas, you're getting to be a fucking pain in the ass.	N
Sir, do we get to win this time?	N
I believe the mind is the best weapon.	N
Are you taking the piss?	N
Now I know you,came back.	N
I fail to recognize the correlation between losing ten grand, hospitalizing Gorgeous, and a good deal.	N
How are we going to explain to Brick Top that his fight isn't going to .	N
Extra Cheese is two dollars.	N
Don't come back, either.	N
Hey, Sal, how come they ain't no brothas on the wall?	N
So since we spend much money here, we do have some say.	N
Oh, he's a lover, man... definitely loves what he does for a living.	N
Nobody appreciates that kind of integrity anymore... the grain, the gritty look you get.	N
All I know is... you're beautiful.	N
I haven't been nice to you.	N
Relax Luther, it's much worse than you think.	Y
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.	N
God damn it, Preston, all you had to do was look her in the eye and lie!	Y
You got it ... and tell Maureen - she doesn't have six hours to put on her face.	Y
What are you trying to do, put the whole ship to sleep?	N
I hope you find it to your liking... it's quite comfortable.	N
The hospitality in this country is as warm as the weather.	N
If our positions were reversed, I would have done the same.	N
This is English courage.	N
I took the bread.	N
How did your uneducated kind ever take Jerusalem?	N
You should not have left without me, Englishman.	Y
If the drug is here, we must destroy it!	Y
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.	N
Next time, learn to work the safety with your punk-ass.	Y
Do I backseat drive when you're tailing a hitman?	N
Don't make me call your mother!	Y
I need to go to the hospital.	N
When you're hanging on by your fingernails, you can't go waving your arms around.	Y
She's not... her heart is strong, she wants to live... can't you see that?	N
It went straight for the warhead, and they think it's cute.	N
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.	Y
These guys are about as much fun as a tax audit.	N
Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.	N
Oh, we totally have to.	Y
Who reads all this shit?	N
Gimme all your money, bitch!	Y
We have to go in here!	N
Well, I have to admit that things are really starting to look up for me since my life turned to shit.	N
You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...	Y
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.	N
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!	N
I'm not gonna let this stand.	N
I appreciate that, I thought this was history.	N
I guess that changes our relationship a bit, huh?	N
Chris I wanna make you head of security.	N
Don't blow smoke up my ass, it will ruin my autopsy.	Y
I'm getting a little dizzy, I can feel my heart pumping --	N
Careful Bill, you'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.	Y
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.	N
When I introduce you, and I tell them who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.	N
Now that we have a moment, would you mind if I expressed my gratitude for what you did for Susan?	N
I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.	Y
'Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill --'	N
You never know, lightning could strike.	N
Depends on the woman I marry.	N
I don't think this is the lightning you're looking for.	N
And now you're all grown up -- and I'm - uh - um --	N
Thank you for loving me.	N
You're the poison, Drew.	N
I wish... you could have known my father.	N
We know all that we need to know --	N
I've got the bullets!	N
Don't be a fool!	Y
I don't want any trouble.	N
You satisfied or you want more?	N
You're tearing me apart!	N
You buy me many things.	N
What does he know about man alone?	N
I guess I'm just no good?	N
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.	N
Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.	N
You know, Agent Desmond, I figure this whole office, furniture included, is worth $27,000.	N
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.	N
Goddamn, these people are confusing.	N
Well, where are you going?	N
Bring in the logic probe!	Y
We'll get them, sir...	N
That M.C.P., that's half our problem right there.	N
Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage...	N
On the other side of the screen, it all looks so easy.	N
I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User.	N
Oh, man, this isn't happening, it only thinks its happening.	N
Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him.	N
Ruby, this fence may be the first thing I ever did that might produce an actual result.	N
But then I've tried counting the number of words which passed between Mr. Inman and me.	N
My daddy - he'd walk forty miles for liquor but not forty inches for kindness.	N
Stobrod called himself a musician -- my daddy -- he could play six tune on a fiddle.	N
So, you have never wrapped your legs around this Inman?	N
We're careful we'll get through the winter now.	N
I've had to put myself in the way of people's kindness.	N
-- Sometimes I think I'm crazy when I'm just hungry -- Ada Monroe.	N
I'm wetter than a fish.	N
I can't get much wetter.	N
I despise a floggin' rooster.	N
There's half the day yet.	N
Let's put him in a pot.	Y
Is that a yes or a no?	N
You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?	N
And you won't be able to take care of them, either.	N
As much as God loves you	N
No, it just makes you doubly	N
As much as Mother Miriam loves me?	N
That's because you keep reminding me.	N
I'm asking for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.	Y
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.	Y
This stuff's nuttier than my shit after I've eaten an Almond Roca!	N
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!	N
I'm just going to shoot you once!	N
That's the most I've ever lifted.	N
They say this one has a surprise ending.	N
A couple I'd thought had broken him...	N
This is an art gallery, my friend, and this is a piece of art.	Y
This is one of seventeen original drawings by Fritz Champion remaining in the world.	N
Pike; "I wouldn't have it any other way", *either*!	N
And you -- and me --did we learn -- being wrong today?	N
What I like, and what I need, are two different things.	N
Because I'm all you've got Because I know him.	N
How are you doing out there in Marlboro country?	N
Hey... She sounds like she's doing all right.	N
Who's going to want me now?	N
Who's ever going to want me?	N
What are you gunna do about it up in your fucking high window with your goddamn binoculars?	N
I just called "Elaine's" and talked to her to see who was in there last night.	N
Sam, I can go at least another nine rounds, but you got to let me in.	Y
And from what I've heard, Lucy's making their life miserable - that's our girl.	N
All you need is love.	Y
You wear too much perfume.	N
You're not affiliated with me!	N
Skippy here made sure of that.	N
Every time they run, we take a shot!	N
I know you're there, Little Miss Disappear.	N
My God, you've gotten fat.	N
Yes, things are going quite well.	N
Does this mean we have to move again?	N
...aced those guys that tried to kill us!	N
People look at me and see my brother.	N
Little Henry Hastings and his older brother Jerome.	N

Here we go again with this, Derek.	N
Look at 'em, ordinary fucking people, I hate 'em.	N
Get in at three A.M. get up at four.	N
The life of a repo man is always intense.	N
Mister Peason is carrying a permit for a pistol.	N
You repo men, you're all out to fuckin' lunch.	N
Well I don't know I mean that's pretty severe.	N
Best god-damn car on the lot...	N
He signed it over to me.	N
You ever feel as if your mind had started to erode?	N
Of course it was folk songs and protest songs back then.	N
Some weird fuckin' shit, eh, Bud?	N
Look Ah this isn't really necessary.	N
I'm not dying in a fucking rat maze!	N
We have to make it down to the bottom.	N
If you don't see it, then it's not real.	Y
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.	N
My professional opinion is that you've managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.	N
Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.	N
It's going to be a long spring.	N
Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.	N
Better step on it, Mr. French!	Y
The east side is always faster.	N
That's a lot of fish.	N
We have to shut them down...	N
The radiation isn't an anomaly, it's the clue.	N
Especially ones that test for catastrophic hormones or clomiphene citrate.	N
I've always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.	N
You said you wanted my trust, then I need yours.	N
I'll show you collateral damage!	Y
Morgan, the guy from 23, right?	N
I don't want to lose my virginity to a piece of fruit.	N
And David..... if tomorrow night does happen, it will never happen again, so...	N
I'm tired and emotional.	N
Never said a truer word.	N

He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.	N
Go back to your banana tree, nigger.	Y
You've got to loosen my hands.	Y
Can I have a piece of toast?	N
Do you think it's a dog?	N
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?	N
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?	Y
I didn't mean to call you a meat loaf, Jack!	N
Fee fi fo fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman.	N
A naked American man stole my balloons.	N
I don't know who you are.	N
I will not be threatened by a walking meat loaf!	N
It's all right, I know I'm being insane.	N
These are like smart bombs, you point them in the right direction and shit gets real.	Y
Well, he said he always thought you and me would make a totally bangin' couple.	N
And sometimes, you might just get lucky in your miserable life.	Y
In fact, they treated the whole incident like a bad dream.	N
Stop kidnapping my girlfriend!	Y
I'm not jello!	N
I checked The Guide for the best way to rescue a prisoner from Vogsphere, it said "don't".	N
You know -- I think sometimes you say things that mean something other than what you're actually saying.	N
It won't affect me, I'm already a woman.	N
We have a couple of hitchhikers in our receiving bay.	N
If there's anything around here more important than my ego, I want it caught and shot now!	N
We've got the police of half the Galaxy after us and we stop to pick up hitchhikers?!	N
I should have said it resembles tea.	N
No, no, Marvin, it's fine really.	N
Hey, what's wrong with Meat Loaf's butt?	N
It's not working any longer -you and me.	N
I walked with a zombie... sounds strange to say.	N
That's past -- that's over and done with...	N
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.	N
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin.	N
Hey, try not to suck any dick on the way through the parking lot!	Y
Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.	N
All right, so they bring in independent contractors, why are you so upset at its destruction?	N
He said he'd be here by noon, but it's one-thirty now, so I...Excuse me...Vermont?	N
I'm not even supposed to be here today!	N
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.	N
I never thought I'd say this, but can I go work now?	N
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --	N
If you *really* wanted to screw me up, you should've gotten to me earlier.	N
The two hours after school and before The Rockford Files, three days in a row.	N
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.	N
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.	Y
Everything's green on my screen, skipper.	Y
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.	N
They say there are only two days you enjoy a boat; the day you buy it and the day you sell it.	Y
We have had security problems and to cut a long story short, I need another seven million Euros lost in the books.	N
Think before you drink before you drive me mad.	Y
I need that picture Archy, I need it bad.	Y
That, Roman and Mickey, is the famous Archie Slap.	N
No need for any noise, let Pete sleep on.	Y
He tried to poison me, that dirty Cossack!	N
That's why he came to me right?	N
Beauty is a cruel mistress, is it not?	N
This is simply a reflection of my appreciation.	N
You're insane, but you might also be brilliant.	N
Sammy, opening for David Brenner is a fine gig.	N
Andy, you have to look inside and ask this question: who are you trying to entertain - the audience or yourself?	Y
You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?	Y
Take me to your cinema.	Y
What am I seeing, Mark?	N
Whatever I photograph I always lose.	N
I was responsible... in some way...	N
I like to understand what I'm shown.	N
Mark, this isn't some kind of jo...	N
What's this have to do with the price of tea in China?	N
And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry.	N
Remember, tomorrow is promised to no one.	Y
I'm not running -- not from you.	N
So, do you want my signed confession now, or after coffee?	N
Usually takes a week for you guys to get to me.	N
But I think once you quit hearing "sir" and "ma'am," the rest is soon to foller.	N
I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.	N
Well, some men, once they get a whiff of it, they trail you like a hound.	N
And when Edmund came along when I saw a chance to stop struggling I took it.	N
Sometimes the shit comes down so heavy I feel like I should wear a hat.	N
But when Matty sees a way to get rid of both of them at once.	N
Unhand me, you mechanical moron.	Y
Doctor Dolittle of outer space.	N
Sarcasm is the recourse of the weak mind.	Y
I shall not be caged like some animal	Y

I'm going to try to reach escape velocity.	N
If this is all a dream, why can't there be more girls?	N
Once or twice more and we're going to be dead in space.	N
I am the soul of discretion.	N
Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds.	N
He is the kindest and best of men.	N
He must have had his reasons for going.	N
Is love a fancy or a feeling... or a Ferrars?	N
But you must promise not to live too far away.	N
We're the CIA, something always goes wrong.	N
But you're sure he'll show up.	N
In this game, the most committed wins.	N

I have a special surprise for you, Mommy!	N
I did one especially for her.. .Nobody responds.	N
I'll shoot Mommy if you tell.	N
You have lovely handwriting, by the way.	N
Don't ever touch my sister again.	Y

E-mail is for geeks and pedophiles.	N
I want to kiss you there.	N
Miss Winston, EVERYBODY has a secret face!	N
I'm so sorry for your loss.	N
Lie still... it's quicker this way	Y
Why did I kill all the others?	N
Never touched a legend before!	N
And you will need me.	N
How much time do we have?	N
But wait, how can that be?	N
I was 27 years old the first time I died.	N
And I felt peace...even though there was war around me.	N
The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up, not my mind!	N
I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...	N
Only a car full of Stellas and Guidos would ride your ass on a 2-lane highway and honk.	N
Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you?	N
What the hell are you doin' Sister Gonorrhea, waitin' for a bus?	N
You know, your coming here reminds me of a gospel called The Prodigal Son.	N
Now there's an intelligently biting remark wrought with wit and irony.	N
Cause when I'm mad enough, I can bite down very hard.	N
You just upset the Incredible Hulk, his idiot half brother, and the two circus clowns.	N
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?	N
Forget about the curve ball Ricky, give him the heater.	Y

We should've got the live chicken.	N
Can I borrow one of those, man?	N
Good morning, gentlemen, and welcome to another season of Indians baseball.	Y

Nice throw, dickhead.	N
Guy's goin'.	N
You are a savage creature John Spartan, and I wish for you to leave my domicile now!	Y
The rampant exchange of bodily fluids was one of the major reasons for the downfall of society.	N
Hey Luke Skywalker, use the force.	Y
L.A.P.D., I mean San Angeles P.D.	N
You're gonna regret this the rest of your life... both seconds of it.	Y

Mr Stamper, would you please kill those bastards!	Y
Lovely night for a shipwreck, isn't it?	N
Can't you people keep anything locked up?	N
We were bringing it back from Hong Kong.	N
No lad who has liberty for the first time, and twenty guineas in his pocket, is very sad, and Barry rode towards Dublin thinking not so much of the kind mother left alone, and of the home behind him, but of tomorrow, and all the wonders it would bring.	N
I am locked into my chamber at night, like a felon, and only suffered to leave it when ordered into the presence of my lord, to be present at his orgies with his boon-companions, and to hear his odious converse as he lapses into the disgusting madness of intoxication.	N
Tomo-chan told me to.	N
How was work, mommy?	N
I feel like a virgin on prom night.	N
You kids ought to go up to bed.	N
I'm a little too old to be playing "Hardy Boys meet Reverend Werewolf"!	N
An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.	N

I wanna kiss ya-ya don't have to kiss me back if ya don't feel like it.	N

Lt. Mitchell, would you please try to shoot it again?	N
Everyone's trying to get out of Washington, and we're the only schmucks trying to get in.	N
Since nineteen fifty whatever you guys have had that space ship, the thing you found in New Mexico.	N
Now that's what I call a close encounter	N
You won't exactly need radar to find it.	N
A toast, to the end of the world.	N
All I did was stumble onto their signal.	N
It's Air Force One for crying out loud and still he gets sick!	N
All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David.	N
All you need is love, John Lennon, smart man, shot in the back very sad.	N

Whoever wrote this episode should DIE.	N
Computer, open the second blast sectoot.	N
I avoided capture by using your Mak'tar stealth haze.	N
I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but..	N
It's the simple things in life you treasure.	Y
It's like throwing gasoline on a flame.	N
Why did you even bother to show up?	N
That was a hell of a thing.	N
A month ago, he ate my sandwich.	N
I see you've managed to get your shirt off.	N
Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...	N
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills Guy.	N
Computer, we're going to need some privacy... Close blast section 29 please.	N
Could you possibly try NOT to hit EVERY SINGLE ONE?	N
Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt.	N
By Grapthar's hammer... what a savings.	N
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.	N
Maybe I can get a run in.	N
... and then, you know, you grow up.	N
Now get some sleep, I may wish to have sex again before we eat breakfast.	Y
If they reach the island, I want you to discourage them from getting any further.	Y
What is it that your worried about, looking bad at the P.T.A?	N
Maybe Annabelle deserves to find out who really broke up her family.	N
I'm sorry you're sick.	N
I saw her in the shower!	N
Just because you can't see something, doesn't mean it isn't there.	Y
Now that's enough fear for either one of us to kill the other.	N
What... you didn't really think we'd kill the fuckin' koala bear, now did ya?	N
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...	N
You got to shave before you leave the house in a dress like that... and I don't mean your legs.	Y

You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.	N
Does anyone understand a word I'm saying here?	N
What has the old fool got himself into now?	N

Sylvia Plath - interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic by the college girl mentality.	N
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-	N
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.	N
Oh, look, look, there's that ... that's -that's my old house.	N
That sex was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.	N
Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault.	N
Beg my wife's forgiveness, before I blow  your brains out.	N
I'd just become an investigator when I came across Sammy.	N

But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you.	N
Erica, you are a woman to love.	N
I can do it by the way.	N
Harry, your heart attack could be the best thing that's ever happened to me!	N
And if someone like me doesn't write it, where they gonna get it?	N
Schmucks are people too.	N
Am I in it?	N
These are for you to give me when you apologize.	N
I think you can expect just about anything right now.	N
How great is it for you that im not intimidated by your brilliance?	N
There's something radically wrong with the idea that no one loves you.	N
That's really not going to help.	N
I know, nobody's luck lasts forever.	Y
You don't walk off the roof of a building, without leaving something behind.	Y
So I took things into my own hands and I found a way out.	N
My boy's wicked smart.	N
Fuck you, you fat fuck.	N
Hey, let's get off our motha's, afterall, I just got off yours!	N
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked.	N

" But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back.	N
The stars are ageless, aren't they?	N
They're below, waiting for the Princess ...	N
My only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off.	N
I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.	N
Hey, careful, man, there's a beverage here!	N
I can't be worrying about that shit.	N
That rug really tied the room together.	N
Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--	N
H-hey, this is a private residence, man!	N
That gives me a very secure feeling.	N
Fuck it, Dude, let's go bowling.	N
In your wisdom you took him, Lord.	N
At least I'm housebroken.	N
You see a wedding ring?	N
I told that Kraut a fuckin' thousand times, I don't roll on shabbos!	N
So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain.	N
Where's the fucking money Lebowski?	N
Or maybe forfeit it to us--	N
They're gonna kill that poor woman.	N
Dude's car got a little dinged up--	N
Walter, I love you, but sooner or later, you're going to have to face the fact you're a goddamn moron.	Y
And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.	N
Shut the fuck up, Donny.	Y

It's cool, I'm just looking.	N
I kinda feel like God.	N
But for what, you ask?	N
I hope you don't screw like you type.	N
I didn't know your size, so I guessed.	N
You couldn't find your dick in a windstorm.	N
That I'm seeing what I want to see?	N
What are you, Jimmy Olsen, cub reporter for the Daily Asshole?	N
Of course, in Alabama the Tuscaloosa, but that's entirely irrelephant.	N
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey!	N

And this is where we got the job.	N
Welcome to the worst nightmare of all... reality!	N
They were all clues in our little puzzle.	N
I'd fuck her up the ass!	N
The book's a jumping off point.	N
You are fearless in a way that I shall never know.	N
I have always pictured them, in some ways, as our protectors.	N
His will to live is very strong.	N
I sent her because I trust her.	N
Sometimes we don't do things we want to do so that others won't know we want to do them.	Y
It is also my belief, that because of his innocence, those creatures who reside in the woods did not harm him.	N
Papa, I cannot see his color.	N
Lucius Hunt you answer me this moment!	Y
We are grateful for the time we have been given.	N
What manner of spectacle has caught your attention so splendidly?	N
Wherever she is, that little child is in mortal danger.	N
These men may be the only defense you've got.	N
My scrotum is longer than my penis.	N
Yeah, she's really worried about Bruce.	N
I gave you a baby tonight.	N
You can make money fast gambling.	N

I'm a hunka-hunka burninnnnn' love!	N
Told him it was no go...	N
No matter what happened to you.	N
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!	N
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.	N
They're never gonna let you perform naked, I asked!	N
I know it doesn't matter, but on my inner thighs.	N
I don't know about what happened... because once you start writing, it ALL becomes fiction.	N
You express nothing but banalities and, formally speaking, are unable to construct a single compelling sentence.	N
A whole jolly club with jolly pirate nicknames!	N
Who would waste time killing you... besides me?	N
Can't rain all the time...	N
You go to hell, you pervert!	Y
What's all this happy horseshit?	N
Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red light!	N
Oh, I don't like to be beside the seaside...	N
Then I suggest you go home and do the same.	N
I was attacked, two kids tried to set me on fire.	N

All we got to do is tell the story right.	N
You stupid white trash motherfucker, I saw you do it-	N
Come to see the show?	N
Did you hear about Dode?	N
Maybe I'll just sit here and bleed at you.	N

How do ya like how that shit works?	N
I'm relieving you of your command General.	N
Damn it, you're on a need-to-know basis, and you don't need to know.	Y
Check into a hotel, order up some champagne, I'll finish up my business and ...	Y
Mason, the second you don't respect this, it kills you.	Y
I've got some questions for you but they can wait.	N
Yo' hand is nice and supple, like a lady!	N

I think we deserve a little junk food, after the workout we had this morning.	N
I can't believe you don't know how beautiful you are.	N
Do you know how lucky we are to have found each other?	N
I don't think that there's anything worse than being ordinary.	N
Jane, you'd be out of your mind to go with him.	N
Welcome to America's weirdest home videos.	N
I go to school with your daughter.	N
You don't get to tell me what to do ever again.	Y
You are so beautiful... and I would be a very lucky man...	N
I know you think my dad's harmless, but you're wrong.	N
Why, so I could see what freaks you and Dad really are?	N
This is my first time.	N
Not really bad, just... strange.	N
You can swallow a pint of blood before you get sick.	N
Thursday mornings, all I could do was think about next week.	N
His name is Robert Paulson.	N
A piece of corporate art...	N
Deja vu - all over again.	N
Have I been sleeping later?	N
Go ahead, Cornelius, you can cry.	N
Man, his balls are ice cold.	N
Every evening I died, and every evening I was born again, resurrected.	N

Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.	N

You have a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.	N
So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do.	N
Like so many others, I had become a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct.	N
Even the Vild hall clock of galvanized steel, resting on the Klipsk shelving unit.	N
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.	N
Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.	N
If I didn't say anything, people always assumed the worst.	N
Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying.	N
When deep space exploration ramps up, it'll be the corporations that name everything, the IBM Stellar Sphere, the Microsoft Galaxy, Planet Starbucks.	N
I felt sorry for all the guys packing into gyms, trying to look like what Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger said they should.	N
I am Jack's raging bile duct.	N
He was obviously able to handle it.	N
I am Jack's cold sweat.	N
... and you come home to this.	N
If you wake up at a different time in a different place, could you wake up as a different person?	N
No, I just can't believe that card is declined -- Okay, okay, let me give you a different card number.	N
Something on your mind, dear?	N
Your nuts will be bicoastal.	N
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.	N
You're gonna have to keep me up all night.	Y
I flipped through catalogs and wondered: What kind of dining set defines me as a person?	N
He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.	N
After fighting, everything else in your life got the volume turned down.	N
I should have been upset about my nice, neat, flaming little shit.	N

We're on our third pitcher of beer.	N
We have just lost cabin pressure.	N
What's this all about, Tyler?	N
Now, a question of etiquette - as I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?	N
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.	N
You're the worst thing that's ever happened to me.	N
I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.	N
I have a really bad feeling about this.	N
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.	N
General, count me in.	N
Hey, are you awake?	N
I have decided that we shall stay here.	N
Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.	N

There's nothing that can't be done.	N
I just asked one of the detectives downtown.	N
What about it, pretzel man, what's your story?	N
She could erase Dillinger's record if she tried.	N
You give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now.	Y
Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat, we get nothing.	N
I'll probably shit blood tonight.	N
McManus wants to go in shooting.	N
There's no fucking coke.	N
Tell her what happened - Everything.	Y

To love and to happiness forever.	N
Now this is what we need.	N
Normally I don't usually meet people, unless I already know them.	N
I don't care so long as he's not a freak.	N
An honest man is always in trouble, remember that Simon.	Y
I'm sort've what you might call... 'in exile'.	N
Opportunity will move out of the way to let a man pass it by.	Y
He was talking to Mr Deng too, and, well, you know, I was thinking...	N
I learn so much from these magazines Mr. Dang, and I refuse to discriminate between modes of knowing.	N
No, but it's OK. Simon's gunna try to get me a job on the garbage truck.	N
Look, Simon, I made love to your mother about half an hour ago, and now I'm beginning to think that maybe it wasn't such a good idea.	N
Nevertheless, I insist your vocation makes a difference, because to hold out anything other than a spiritual yardstick to reality is to be jerking off grandly into the abyss.	Y
You can't argue about taste.	Y
I'm not so sure sometimes.	N
The world is full of shit indeed.	N
That was before I read your book.	N
I don't know; every man has his breaking point.	N
Like to scare me to death, somethin' that big.	N
Well, if it was a toothbrush I wouldn't ask questions, I'd just quote a price, but then a toothbrush is a non-lethal object, isn't it?	N
They march you in naked as the day you're born, fresh from a Bible reading, skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit they throw on you...	N

Would it help if I explained to them I'm not homosexual?	N
Andy Dufresne - who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side.	N
Not long after the warden deprived us of his company, I got a postcard in the mail.	N

That's right, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake!	N
One day, when I have a long gray beard and two or three marbles rollin' around upstairs, they'll let me out.	N
I wasn't there to see it, but I hear Byron Hadley was sobbing like a little girl when they took him away.	N
The man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks.	Y
So Andy started writing a letter a week, just like he said.	N
I'd like to think that the last thing that went through his head, other than that bullet, was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.	N
...wound up sitting in a row at ten o'clock in the morning, drinking icy cold Black Label beer courtesy of the hardest screw that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.	N
Next time, remind me to do this outside.	Y

This island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up!	N
Just ease you way down the stairs and I'll find the light.	Y
Great, cancer in a box.	N
Oh, God, get me out.	N

I can't run with you, Mickey!	N
Well, I see the usual cast of misfits and dope addicts are here.	N
What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!	N
Look at my face; I was not thinking anything bad about you.	N
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago.	N
I want to tell you my secret now.	N
You have to add some twists and stuff.	Y
Look at my face; I'm not very mad.	N
You didn't take it the time after that.	N
Anna Crowe, I am in love... in love I am.	N
Maybe it's time to say things to someone else?	N
I thought you meant the other Italian restaurant I asked you to marry me in.	N
You don't have to tell me your secret if you don't want to.	N
De profundis clamo ad te, domine.	N
Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.	N
I'm ready to communicate with you now.	N
Thanks for giving me this part, Mr. Cunningham.	N
I thought Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.	N
You were great in the play, Cole.	N
If you could change something in your life, anything at all, what would it be?	N

I beat you, you old bitch!	N
Mr. Jacks nods, heads for home.	N
I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on Moral Abuses.	N
It was something I didn't want to think about.	N
We're not computers, Sebastian, we're physical.	N
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.	N
That was irrational of you... not to mention unsportsmanlike.	N
This is how we do it up there, lad!	N
I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.	N
And this is my savior, J.F.	N
Come with me if you want to live.	Y
Don't make a sound unless I say.	Y
Pain can be controlled - you just disconnect it.	Y
John taught us ways to dust them them.	N
Guard it for me, big buns.	Y
Mission control to Chuck, come in...	Y
Jimmy was the kind of guy that rooted for bad guys in the movies.	N
He'd walk in the door and everybody who worked the room went wild.	N

I don't understand why you have to be such a little bitch about it.	N
Each and every one of these kids just so happens to be 21 years old.	N
I am the fool for Christ, and Paraclete of Caborca.	N
Welbeck, too, was mislaid, overlooked, forgotten to death, you see.	N
Hey, the van's on fire!	N
I hate when you do that.	N
He's not drunk, Mom, he's just eccentric.	N
I think you might have said something like that.	N
So sharp, you won't feel a thing...	N
Well, everything's right in this world, Kiddo.	Y
They say even the proudest spirit can be broken... with love.	Y
There's just one tiny little thing we have to do.	N
You know, when you get it wrong, you really get it wrong!	N
Also, we haven't had a chance to speak since THAT week.	N
Will someone please save these people from themselves!	N
It's unimaginable this country being a republic.	N
Dammit, Janet, I love you.	N
We must have a blow-out.	N

She says a lot of things.	N
'Tis the season, convict.	N
Searching for a money man...	N
My father was an exceptional man...	N

For all my education, accomplishments and so-called wisdom, I can't fathom my own heart.	N
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.	N
I had a great evening; it was like the Nuremberg Trials.	N
And, and Nietzsche with his, with his Theory of Eternal Recurrence.	N
Then at lunch she got drunker and drunker and finally she became Joan Collins!	N
With you as her mother her father could be anybody in Actors' Equity!	N

What is your damage, Heather?	N
I was talking with someone!	N
Grow up Heather, bulimia's so '87.	N
They should throw his ass in jail.	N
Dear Diary, my teen-angst bullshit now has a body count.	N
Suicide gave Heather depth, Kurt a soul, Ram a brain.	N
Whether to kill yourself or not is one of the most important decisions a teenager can make.	Y
Let's be able to say we were the ones who put peer pressure out to pasture.	N
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.	N
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow.	N
I knew that loose was too noose... uh... noose too loose...	N
Man, I've even got a marked-up Catcher in the Rye.	N
It's one thing to want someone out of your life, but it's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup full of liquid drainer.	Y
All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized.	N
Great pate, mom, but I gotta motor if I wanna be ready for that party tonight.	N
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun.	Y
Is it really necessary for you to always say no before you say yes?	N
I have a young wife but I'm having sex with my old wife.	N
I don't want to get you drunk, but, ah, that's a very fine Chardonnay you're not drinking.	N
And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.	N
If you don't shut your fucking mouth, I will kill you.	N
Listen, if you could talk to them I would really appreciate it.	N
}: I'm not really hungry, I just need to have reservations somewhere.	N
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on.	N
Don't touch the watch.	N
We're not through yet...	N
I have to return some videotapes.	N
Not in the mood, I guess.	N
Your compliment was sufficient, Luis.	N
It's a plain end.	N
You're not confused, are you?	N
So...it was hot out today, no?	N
Pumpkin, you're dating an asshole.	N
Listen, what are you doing tonight?	N
I can't really play the buttsack.	N
Maybe we should be going to church!	N
You, madam, are addressing a man, who is in fact quiet... and yet, not quiet, if I may offer to you a riddle.	N
But won't the feline eventually tire of his lonely perch and, pining for his master's affection, return on his own initiative?	N
You brought your bitch to the Waffle Hut?	N
...You brought your bitch to the waffle house?	N
And what, to flog a horse, that if not dead is at this point in mortal danger of expiring, does this little square represent?	N
The revulsion I feel for modern popular music, and all other manifestations of contemporary decay, is, I have no doubt, the equal of y'own.	N

Someday I think you and I are going to have a serious disagreement.	N
While it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!	N
The thing that haunts a guy is the stuff he wasn't ordered to do.	Y
In Korea, we stacked fucks like you five feet high and used you as sandbags.	N

I'm a mother with one child on his wedding day looking like he's been condemned to death.	N
I'm getting a little concerned about what I'm seeing on some of these reruns.	N
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.	N
I could, like, kill a guy with these things.	N
I know, I know--He's just like so FINE ...	N
I ask you to kill Superman, and you're telling me you couldn't even do that one, simple thing.	N
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!	N
George, didn't you ever want to know what's on the other side of the mountain?	N
Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?	N
I think I'm going to like it here.	N
I want to show this whole layout to Chang.	N
Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation go course...	N
His last words to me were, "I place in your hands, my son, the future and destiny of Shangri-La.	N
If you piss in your pants, you only stay warm for so long.	Y
I was working, maybe I would've been able to do something, but...	N
You failed because you had the wrong dream... What do you know about cocaine?	N
Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.	N
Well, I get darn sick of tryin' to pick up after a gang of fast-talking salesmen dumb enough to sell life insurance to a guy who sleeps in the same bed with four rattlesnakes.	N
And I'm the guy that has to sit here up to my neck in phony claims so they won't throw more money out of the window than they take in at the door.	N
Do I laugh now, or wait 'til it gets funny?	N
Only we're not going to do it other ways.	N
Walter, you're all washed up.	N
Got some thing better to do?	N
That's a honey of an anklet you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.	N
Because she's made you feel like a heel all of sudden.	N
You shouldn't be callin' people lousy little shrimps, Oscar, unless you're referrin' to the family resemblance in your brother here.	Y
Prove what the big shots say is true -- we're street rats with no brains and no respect for nothin' -- includin' ourselves!	N
Even if that guy was charming and funny, I still wouldn't like him.	N
She did it because she got off on it, she did it for fun.	N
Before I was the Thumbprint Killer, Mr. Smith, I killed a lot of people in a lot of different ways.	N
... and you stand there, not too far away and you shoot me, I should fall straight back into the hole.	N
I never feel sorry for anything that happens to a woman.	N
You seem to like to do business through windows, Mr. Harolday.	N
Has somebody come to town!	N
George Clews is in town.	N
I got a tree on my back and a haint in my house, and nothing inbetween but the daughter I'm holding in my arms.	N
...Days of watching my children sleep away the morning...And taking care of my baby like it was the most important thing I had to do...	N
You got two feet, Sethe, not four.	N
Was never no beating under Mr. Garner.	N
We have a ghost here, you know?	N
I think maybe baby's got plans.	N
Tim, you're just a lost ball in the high weeds.	N
You don't know anything about Komako, now do you, Tim?	N
The only arithmetic he ever got was hearing the referee count up to ten.	N

Walter, as your lawyer I'm advising you to stay the fuck away from me.	Y

Because I haven't seen her in six weeks.	N

Your partner told me he was under the weather.	N
Oh yeah and with friends like you who needs friends?	N
Did you say my mother gave you a hand job?	N
I know about you and the teacher.	N
Where's Mrs. Blume tonight, Mr. Blume?	N
Kids don't like it when their parents get divorced.	N
Let's just hope it's got a happy ending.	N
Tell that stupid Mick he just made my list of things to do today.	N
I'll just be out nude getting hand jobs from the woman you love.	N
I'm sorry, I just came by to thank you for WRECKING MY LIFE!	N
I'm a former student of Rushmore Academy, which I recently got expelled from.	N
God save me, and watch over you all.	N
You're goddamned right I'll move fast.	N
I'd use the chain if I were you.	N
By the way, you may be older than that!	N
Got it, got it, need it, got it...	N
What do you want to melt him with?	N
This is the minister of international development here, he should be talking about... food parcels... not... fucking, arse-spraying mayhem!	N
As soon as I heard about the wall, I spoke to him and he decided you had to go.	N
In the words of the late, great Nat King fucking Cole, unforeseeable, that's what you are.	N
You know, I've met some psychos in my time, but none as fucking BORING as you.	N
I have a job for you but I don't have much time.	N
Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?	N
Now get out of the car and shoot him in the head!	Y
And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.	N
Damn doesn't anyone know where the damn driveway is!	N
I guess I never looked at it like that before.	N
This ain't no picnic bitch!	N
The plan just done changed, Tree.	N
You that weak fuck from the club.	N
I ain't down enough for y'all --	N
We may not have a woodshed on board, but that boy is gonna get a whuppin' anyway!	N
I believe you gentlemen are the polar opposites of a moral dilemma and I'm stuck in the middle.	N
Well, who's a boy gonna talk to if not his mother?	N
Your mind's so filthy, it's hard even to look at you.	N
Jump in my nightmare, the water's warm!	Y
-- "I'll be out there cheering for you.	N
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work.	Y
I mean, he must have been needing that.	N
You are hanging on by a very thin thread and I dig that about you!	N
We ain't gonna bring Nike to their knees with some regional camel ad --	N
Have you ever gotten the feeling that you aren't completely embarassed yet, but you glimpse tomorrow's embarrassment?	N
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.	N
I'm not trying to make history here.	N
Don't you even see -- I'm finished.	N
Don't worry, I'm not gonna do what you all think I'm gonna do, which is, you know, FLIP OUT!	Y
So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me.	N
You bet on me like I bet on you.	N
It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides.	N
You just got killed by a Daewoo Lanos, motherfucker!	N
I'm sure it won't be that hard.	N
I should call Angie soon... Make up some bullshit...	N
Yeah, but Saul, he's a fucking drug dealer.	N
Has anyone seen my bigger knife?	N
We should have this under control.	N
I wish we could just go nowhere.	N
Well, how much money do you have?	N
I'm the poet and you're my muse.	N
She's a little pissed off right now but...	N
We're gonna fuck death away!	N

I think I'm having a nervous breakdown.	N
Come get me if you love me baby.	Y
Come on, let's get some tacos.	N
Come on man, I gotta fly.	N
What's wrong with being a large mammal?	N
Hey, fuck him, let's eat this thing.	N
Actually I don't remember being born, It must have happened during one of my black outs.	N
Did you know Nietzsche said, "all good consciousness, all evidence of truth comes only from the senses"?	Y
Some of the worst mistakes of my life have been haircuts.	N
Where is the wine -- the new wine -- dying on the vine?	N
Have you ever eaten human flesh?	N
I'm talkin' 'bout DANCIN.	N
This is gonna ruin my whole day!	N
Parker, we have to talk, like rational people.	N
Everything is backwards now, like out there is the true world, and in here is the dream.	N
I'm learning to read the trails, the tracks at the water-hole, the tiniest scents and sounds.	N
Sky People can not learn, they do not see.	N
Where ever you are, come back to me now.	N
Shut up and fly straight!	N
The People call it Toruk.	N
And that's how you scatter the roaches.	N
I can tack it onto the after-action report.	N
All I ever wanted was a single thing worth fighting for.	N
If it ain't rainin' we ain't trainin'!	N
Stay alive a little longer.	Y
Tell me your last name.	N
Sometimes, if things are closed, you just, open them up.	Y

Kirill, we don't kill little babies.	Y
Your dad has gone too far, Kirill.	N
So, you know where I am...and now I know where you are, Anna Ivanovna.	N
It is good to have someone who I can trust to do simple tasks.	N
It's a business lie, it's different from a life lie.	N
The thing is Oscar...and this is important to learn early...life is sales.	N
Fuck you and the horse you rode in on.	N
All those women, and what they did about Walter....	N
It's raining cats, dogs, and democrats out there, this better be worth it.	N
You can't just stay in the U.S. as long as you want, pal.	N
Mrs. Collins, if that boy's your son I'll eat my yard stick.	N
You must know which one it is, you sat there for over a year.	N
The color guard is colored!	N
All right, boys, itsy authorities!	N
A woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days of man.	N
And I've traveled many a weary mile to be back with my wife and six daughters.	N
Do not seek the treasure!	Y
I know we're kin!	N
where's the happy little tire swing?	N
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?	N
I don't want FOP Damn it, I'm a Dapper Dan Man!	N
It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-	N
When I think back on my relationship with Mr. Novotny, what I miss most... is our talks.	N
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.	N
I sure was surprised the day Lisa Flanagan asked me for a ride home and ended up blowing me.	N
First Lisa has a big fight with my sister, and the next thing you know she's my girlfriend.	N
Her pussy gets so wet you can't believe it.	N
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?	N
Good morning, Mr. M. Looks like you could use a CUPCAKE!	N
There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.	N

To a night the four of us will never forget!	N
That said, let's not get too stupid tonight, okay?	N
Frank Wheeler, I think you're the most interesting person I've ever met.	N
I mean it's kind of an important day for you, isn't it?	N
Knowing what you've got, knowing what you need, knowing what you can do without - That's inventory control.	N
I think it was a simple case of wanting to be a man again after all that abortion business.	N
It takes backbone to lead the life you want, Frank.	Y
And what do you think you're going to do?	N
Just because you've got me safe in this little trap, you think you can bully me into feeling whatever you want me to feel!	N
Just give them - you know, give them each a kiss for me, and give them my love, and tell them - you know... All right, Milly.	N
If being crazy means living life as if it matters, then I don't mind being completely insane.	N
It's what you are that's being denied and denied and denied in this kind of life.	Y
You know, I wish I had my board with me... even if I could just wax it once in a while.	N
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu.	N
Don't give me any of that intelligent life crap, just give me something I can blow up	N
I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...	N
Now more than ever we need the Jedi.	N
But they didn't put me in prison.	N
There's nothing but a dark world of pain locked in that building.	N
Cause I don't forgive you, I don't forgive you for dying.	N
All I see are dead people.	N
The guy was a total fruitcake.	N
Who cares what psychiatrists write on walls?	N
What virus are we talking about, Dad?	N
I'm looking for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.	N
Where I come from we think of this as Eden.	N
People are frightened by what they don't understand.	Y
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.	N
Thanks for having me and my irresponsible child over your house.	N
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?	N
Yum, this pretzel tastes like a freaking DONUT!	N
Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.	N
Hi, I'm calling to procure a hasty abortion...	N
I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?	N
I could so go for like a huge cookie right now, with like, a lamb kabob simultaneously.	N
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.	N
I never realize how much I like being home unless I've been somewhere really different for a while.	N
Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right.	N
It ended with a chair.	N
You're just golden, dude.	N
I think that kids get bored and have intercourse.	N
And Juno's not going to be a ma.	N
Thank you... you said 'someone'... not 'something'.	N
...And this man on the hill comes.	N
You never could hit a curve ball!	N
Be careful in that big City, Clark.	Y
Lenny, I've always considered you the Dutch Elm disease in my family tree.	N
I did what I could but he's kind of lovesick for the girl.	N
I hope life on Earth is everything you remember it to be.	N
Sam, when you first arrived at Selene, there was a small crash.	N
Gerty, is there someone else in the room?	N
Who is that guy in the Rec Room?	N
You'd be surprised about what you can get, if you ask for it the right way.	Y
I know of a guy he goes in the bank holding a bottle he says is nitroglycerin.	N
Walter, you're wonderful, in a loathsome sort of way.	N
That's the first time you've been right today.	N
If you was worth breaking my nails on I'd tear your face wide open.	N
And still I was the only one with guts enough to stand up for him!	N
Listen to me, you great big bubble-headed baboon!	Y
I'm not working for any other paper!	N
Madam, you are a cock-eyed liar!	N
We've got to get bail.	N
I'm not even listening.	N
I was holding for someone.	N
Thank you for talking about me behind my back - that'll be useful in court.	N
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.	N
What kind of mother can't stand her own son?	N
Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?	N
It's not my back that's killing me.	N
Josh, you look like you could use a hug.	N
Why can't you all just die and leave me alone?	N
Would you like to help us finish the house, Mr. Dokos?	N
Build this house with me.	Y
Not home with your mother.	N
An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.	Y
My message tonight is the message I have given to your brothers everywhere.	Y
If you are a minority of one, the truth is the truth.	Y
Ba -- we will need another place set for Mr. Walker's driver.	N
We'll be goin' now that your sign is no longer impeding our forward progress.	N
Well, I think we should just make our delivery as soon as possible, don't you?	N
Everything made sense... until Box.	N
I wonder what they are?	N
Logan... you renewed!	N
At Carousel tonight?	N
Except for socially, you're my role model.	N
I've got four hours of French demonstrations --	N
You really blew the lid off of nookie	N
Just tell me what's really going on.	N
Do you do bunny rabbits?	N
Give me some of that.	N
I think we have the kind of friendship where if I were the devil, you'd be the only one I would tell.	N
Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.	N
Let's never forget, we're the real story, not them.	Y
When you speak to him he's not at all nuts.	N
I say it here, it comes out there.	N
I've been to your house a lot...	N
Welcome to Wonderland, Alice.	N
Your shift is over.	N
How's this for a wet dream?	N
Hari-kari to you and your balance, boy.	Y
All right, I'm gonna punch his ticket in.	N
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.	N
Michael, why are the drapes open?	N
I'm going to the market.	N
Hyman Roth has been dying from the same heart attack for the last twenty years.	N
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.	N
I'd give four million just to be able to take a piss without it hurting	N
When I wake up, if it's still there, I'll know I have a partner.	N
I don't want anything to happen to him while my mother's alive.	N
I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.	N
I left my number in your undies!	N
Me, Tonto, and Robin the Boy Wonder.	N
Take this beast back to his cage!	Y
Perhaps your kettles are stained with rust.	N
I love you Madeleine... as a child of God.	N
I've good news; I hope you'll agree.	N
It's an entire religion based on an oxymoron.	N
Rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet, Abbe.	N
You can't be a proper writer without a touch of madness, can you?	Y
What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.	N
Ah, you've come to read my trousers.	N
Suppose you only put it in her mouth --	N
He's a writer, not a madman.	N
No one's forcing you to listen.	N
Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when lubricated.	Y
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.	Y
Don't come any closer Abbe, God's watching.	Y
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!	N
Your terrible secret revealed, you're a man after all.	N
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.	Y
You've already stolen my heart... as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator.	N
We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw.	N
Some men are beyond redemption.	Y
Don't you see, Abbe?	N
If you're going to martyr yourself Abbe, do it for God, not the chambermaid.	N
Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work.	N
What a strange person.	N
Perhaps he was dictating.	N
We are the Knights who say... NI.	N
Do you think he meant the Camargue?	N
If you don't mind, I'm gonna pass out.	N
If I was healthy, I could take that away from you.	N
All good things come to those who wait.	N
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead.	N
We called him Mother Superior on account of the length of his habit.	N
The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --	N
Even his hands are oily.	N
What're you talking about?	N
When I can walk, I'll run.	N
Are you an expert on this now?	N
There is now a level zero.	N
Why don't you try again?	N
I just don't understand it.	N
Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.	N
Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac.	Y
We should have lunch sometime.	N
I never thought Kennedy was ready for the presidency.	N
Did you see the look on Hoover's face?	N
I hope I haven't let you down.	N
He was your ally for twenty years, Leonid.	N
Can you imagine what this man would be like had anyone ever loved him?	N
I never suggested for some imbeciles to go break into a psychiatrist's office.	N
We created Frankenstein with these damn Cubans.	N
How long have you known him, Bob?	N
I bet if I was President they wouldn't have killed me.	N
Don't worry -- I'll use the old Nixon charm on her.	N
There is no place for excuses when you are the LEADER!	Y
Raphael, there are better ways to use your skills in ninjitsu.	Y
This night just keeps getting better.	N
Don't mess with the Nightwatcher!	Y
Welcome to Pacific Tech's "Smart People on Ice".	N
You didn't straighten the place up, did you?	N
You wanted to see me, Your Joggingness?	N
He's been irradiating corn with strontium.	N
In nineteen minutes, this area's gonna be a cloud of vapor the size of Nebraska.	N
I'm sorry if I gave you a scare but that platform was just becoming too unstable...	N
You always were an asshole, Gorman!	N
Who's the fresh meat again?	N
Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!	Y
We got tactical smart-missles, phased-plasma pulse-rifles, RPG's.	N
Sy Ableman was a serious man.	N
It is automatically mailed to you.	N
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.	Y
Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get out, you know?	N
Either pull the trigger or get that fucking thing out of my face.	Y
When he's done with his shower, you will go to the bar.	N
I have this image of you - inside of me - like a part of me.	N
My pleasure ... but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.	N
When you get tired of Cagney and Lacey, find me.	N
I'm fucking up, that's what I'm doing.	N
If there's one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind-reading.	N
Some instinct took over and as everyone, including Waxman, dove down, I reached up and emptied the cash register.	N
I was just yankin' your chain.	N
If he could only see you now.	N
Well Daddy, it's harvest time.	N
You were only six years old.	N
Forgive me, I'm blowing your mind.	N
You're right on the money, Julie.	N
The little things... there's nothing bigger, is there?	N
So all I have to do is imagine something?	N
Julie Gianni is your fuck buddy?	N
I'm surprised you're available.	N
A radio's a little box that you buy on the installment plan, and before you tune it in, they tell you there's a new model out.	N
Well, I am the last person to persuade you, but don't do it blindly... if this is your decision, you must be prepared to face the consequences...	Y
Monsieur LaPadite, to both your family and your cows I say: Bravo.	N
However, I've been lead to believe you speak English quite well?	N
I'm gonna give you a little somethin' you can't take off.	N
Just try puttin a bag over his head, and hear what kinda sounds he makes.	Y
It's been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover.	N
Everybody take your seatsl Col.Landa, Lt.Aldo, and Bridget are still together.	N
Bring that fucker over here!	Y
Prepare to die, collaborator fucker!	Y
Trust no one, Mr. Mulder.	Y
You have precious little time.	N
I don't believe the FBI currently has an investigative unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand.	N
These are fossilized bone fragments I've been able to study, gathered from the bomb site in Dallas...	N
What does it mean, "exact change"?	N
As you observed, a primitive Culture.	N
Everybody remember where we parked.	N
We'll divide into teams.	N
It is difficult to answer, when one does not understand the question.	Y
Mr. President, I have come to speak on behalf of the accused.	N
May fortune favor the foolish.	Y
Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!	N
Admiral, there be whales here!	N
I'll have to re-energize.	N
This is an extremely primitive and paranoid culture.	N
Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise.	N
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?	N
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.	N
That's my new favorite camel.	N
I want to show you something.	N
Eat your waffles, fat man.	Y
Doesn't that worry you?	N
and being who he wasn't, could be as he wished to be	N
And then, as if a curtain had been pulled back from the sky...	N
Trying to get something real by telling yourself stories is a trap.	N
It isn't a Spanish band, but they'll do their best.	N
You were the only audience I ever needed.	N
Let's get the hell out of Russia.	Y
If your God should persecute me into the next world, then I shall simply have to find myself another.	N
Connor stands atop the burning pyre, wicked tongues of flame leaping off his back and shoulders like fiery wings.	N
Faith, I told you I look like a fucking orange.	N
Guess that put it a little too close to home.	N
Because I loathe bananas!	N
Cornelius -- where are we?	N
Forget everything you've seen on television and in the movies.	Y
You are presented with a simple fact: Andrew Beckett was fired.	N
Now, explain it to me like I'm a four-year-old.	N
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?	N
Now don't make a move or that dog will tear you to shreds.	Y
They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.	N
Oh, Nicky, I love you because you know such lovely people.	N
They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --	N
What's that man doing in my drawers?	N
He's got more sense than you have.	N
There's only one person in the world who's going to decide what I'm going to do and that's me...	N
With Mr. Rogers out of the way, Reilly, I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state.	N
Well, your best better get a hell of a lot fucking better, or you are gonna feel a hell of a lot fucking worse.	Y

Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.	N
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.	N
You've always been crazy, this is just the first chance you've had to express yourself.	N
Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?	N
Come on, Louise, don't blow it.	N
No, Louise, you said the first part.	N
The last time I had a pap smear, the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.	N
If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed...well, you got yourself a keeper.	N
Is the only way you can succeed is to see me fail?	N
God, even you want to tell me what I can't do.	N
I swear, you and that guy Disney, in love with the damn rats.	N
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell.	N

Grant Goodeve--the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH.	N
That woman was a slut-bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.	N
On the off chance I get caught-a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?.	N
What do I have to do to prove to you that I'm not a killer?	N
Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...	N
We all go a little mad sometimes.	N
Yeah...and when I called no one answered.	N
No, please don't kill me, Mr. Ghostface, I wanna be in the sequel!	N

My body will heal, but this was the last pair left in my size.	N
I believe the word you're looking for is "Aaahh"!	N
I'm starting... just starting... to lose my temper, now.	N
Why is their always someone who brings eggs and tomatoes to a speech?	N
All I want in return ... is the chance to ... to find my folks.	N
You know what, I mistook me for somebody else.	N
Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...	N
Well, the party never stops on Selina Kyle's answering machine...	N
But I'm a working girl, gotta pay the rent.	N
They wouldn't put me on a pedestal, so I'm layin' 'em on a slab!	N
