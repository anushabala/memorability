And so she walked out of our lives forever.	M
Forgive me if I don't shake hands.	M
I don't think I'll let you arrest us today, Behan.	M
I just think us girls should stick together.	N
We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.	N
Where did you pick up that cheap trick?	M
Die screaming motherfucker.	M
Suck on it.	N
You couldn't hit a lake if you were standing on the bottom.	M

Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?	N
Damn doesn't anyone know where the damn driveway is!	M
I guess I never looked at it like that before.	N
You that weak fuck from the club.	M
I ain't down enough for y'all --	N
-- "I'll be out there cheering for you.	N
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work.	M
Have you ever gotten the feeling that you aren't completely embarassed yet, but you glimpse tomorrow's embarrassment?	M
I'm not trying to make history here.	M
Don't you even see -- I'm finished.	N
So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me.	N

All those women, and what they did about Walter....	N

It's what you are that's being denied and denied and denied in this kind of life.	N
You know, I wish I had my board with me... even if I could just wax it once in a while.	M
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu.	N

We've got to get bail.	N
Thank you for talking about me behind my back - that'll be useful in court.	M

Bash the door in!	N
So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?	N
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.	N
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.	N
Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?	N

You can do nothing to me!	N
I talked to a girl...	N
She's a good woman, Louise.	N
Come on, you guys--before you miss the boat.	N
"Springtime for Hitler" a gay romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden... Wow!	M
I'm in pain and I'm wet and I'm still hysterical!	M
Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.	N
If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost someplace!	M
