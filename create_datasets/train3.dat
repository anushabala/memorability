Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...	N
What's this all about, Tyler?	N
Go on and read it, John, and then start socking!	N
I - I don't know, Bill.	N
Hang on tightly, let go lightly.	M
What virus are we talking about, Dad?	N
It was our money and we want it back.	N
I'll have to re-energize.	N
Can I go forward when my heart is here?	N
Lucius Hunt you answer me this moment!	N
Au contraire baby, you can't resist me.	M
The first and most important rule of gun-running is: Never get shot with your own merchandise.	M

I mean, he was already in Vegas a couple of years and he had the fuckin' place clocked.	N
Why'd you have to get us into this, Foxy?	N
Would it help if I explained to them I'm not homosexual?	N
NOBODY'S GONNA PUT ME TO SLEEP!	N
Well, kiddo, I thought you outgrew superstition.	M
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?	N
Don't matter what kin' either.	N
Now, on top of everything else, I gotta make sure no one fucks around with the Golden Jew.	M
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.	N
Knowing what you've got, knowing what you need, knowing what you can do without - That's inventory control.	M
Captain, shall we raise our shields?	N
What is your malfunction, you fat barrel of monkey spunk?	M
Mrs. Peel, you're needed.	M
Then I suggest you go home and do the same.	N
Don't worry Jennie.	N
Cause I don't forgive you, I don't forgive you for dying.	N
Joe College strikes out.	M
I just wish I understood what they were telling me.	N
We fell from grace together.	N
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.	N
Prove what the big shots say is true -- we're street rats with no brains and no respect for nothin' -- includin' ourselves!	N
We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.	N
Hey, fuck him, let's eat this thing.	N
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is?	N
I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.	N
... and then, you know, you grow up.	N
Man, they got a shit load of cookies!	M
I was making time with your girl.	N
They abide, and they endure.	M
My eyes still hurt from reading that movie.	M
You, madam, are addressing a man, who is in fact quiet... and yet, not quiet, if I may offer to you a riddle.	M
Does my inner child need a spanking?	M
I'd be monarch of all I survey....	N
Also, we haven't had a chance to speak since THAT week.	N
and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.	N
Yeah - I have that effect on people.	M
I don't think you should tell her she doesn't have blood...	M
Well, I don't think that store dick is gonna want this.	N
Trying to get something real by telling yourself stories is a trap.	M
He was conceived during one of our rituals.	M
Die screaming motherfucker.	M
You stay away from my wife, my life, my home, and my skunk!	M
Let's snuff the sucka.	M
Made the semi-finals, didn't you?	N
We are grateful for the time we have been given.	M
This is the coolest thing I have ever seen.	M
Thanks for giving me this part, Mr. Cunningham.	N
You can't argue about taste.	M
Billy, take the radio, leave the rest.	N
You'd be surprised about what you can get, if you ask for it the right way.	M
Even if it's just banging its head against a rock.	N
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu.	N
I don't think I'll ever dry out.	M
Stern, if this factory ever produces a shell that can actually be fired, I'll be very unhappy.	M
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....	N
Come with me if you want to live!	M
Damn it, you're on a need-to-know basis, and you don't need to know.	M
Anyway, I guess you could say me and Momma was on our own.	N
I just love the feel of tuck and roll upholstery.	N
Oh, you amuse me, Roy, but I'm the only woman in America born after World War II that thinks astrology's a crock of shit.	M
What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!	N
Oh, look, look, there's that ... that's -that's my old house.	N
This is pricks ficks.	N
I wish there was some way I could just pay the fine and go home.	M
Maybe I'll just sit here and bleed at you.	M
You know, all things considered, Data, I think you have nicer eyes.	M
I could, like, kill a guy with these things.	M
There are some mistakes you cannot risk when you have children.	M
Just going to the kitchen to get some food, then I'm going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins.	M
What the hell you doin', Grace?	N
I just... we're running a little late.	N
The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see?	N
What do I have to do to prove to you that I'm not a killer?	M
where's the happy little tire swing?	M
Tell me... do you like music, Mr. Finch?	M
Come on, Louise, don't blow it.	M
Well, I guess that's the way life works, isn't it?	N
Here she stopped and, closing her eyes, took a deep breath of the flower-scented air of the broad expanse around her.	N
His name is the Count De Rochefort.	N
Don't they ever stop migrating?	M
I don't know what I'm doing.	M
I'm sure it won't be that hard.	N
This kind of murder...	N
We've got to get bail.	N
Look kid, why don't you go out and win a few races, then come back and see me.	N
This doesn't make any sense.	M
And what do you think you're going to do?	N
Your partner told me he was under the weather.	N
And I'm BACK IN THE GAME!	M
You know your head ain't on straight?	M
Come on up and watch TV.	M
I see you've managed to get your shirt off.	M
May the forks be with us.	M
She's a good woman, Louise.	N
I should have been upset about my nice, neat, flaming little shit.	N
His will to live is very strong.	M
I want you to exit this guy off the premises, I want you to exit him off his feet and I want you to use his head to open the fucking door.	M
A person doesn't change just because you find out more.	M
I will not give him up to them.	N
Three weeks ago, all I thought about was... well I didn't actually think about anything.	M
I shall trade you the Compass, if you will help me... to find this.	N
No doubt they're as foul as the stuff you set on your table....	N
If there's one thing this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have it.	M
Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.	N
And if someone like me doesn't write it, where they gonna get it?	N
Well, you didn't think I forgot about you, did you?	M
Shit on my dick, or blood on my knife?	M
No -- don't you see -- crawling --	N
You drop this bombshell on me.	N
I'm not working for any other paper!	N
A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.	N
I'm ready to shoot RIGHT NOW.	M
Bring in that floating fat man, the Baron!	M
You just stay in the car and watch and be ready.	N
He should join the Marines, they could make something out of him.	N
I'm surprised you're available.	N
You're in the middle of a police station.	N
Mr. President, I have come to speak on behalf of the accused.	N
What're you talking about?	N
Inside the packet you'll find a clearly worked out severance package.	N
So what's this money deal you were talking about?	N
It's not contaminated, you don't even know what that word means.	M
You know, a good cop will never let you know he knows you're full of shit.	M
I've got a proposition for you.	N
Well, I think we should just make our delivery as soon as possible, don't you?	N
Get out of my facial!	M
I'm not sure I agree with you a hundred percent on your police work, there, Lou.	M
Yeah, well, that's a Hazard of the jjj...	N
It was nice to see you again, Ally.	N
We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.	N
We've got to get a new travel agent.	M
How terrible is wisdom, when it brings no profit to the wise.	M
The Batbook is pecking at his eyes!	N
Well... You can want in one hand and shit in the other, and see which one fills first.	M
It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-	N
In the future, when a woman is crying like that, she isn't having any fun.	M
See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.	N
I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.	N
Put these clothes on!	N
We can't hold out forever Kup, but we *can* give them one *humongous* repair bill.	M
If you could change something in your life, anything at all, what would it be?	M
So you can take us to St. Rose.	N
Sleep is for the weak Mr. President.	M
It'd be as well to let it go.	N
Tell me your last name.	N
Kids - 10 seconds of joy, 30 years of misery.	M
The first step is love, the second is mercy.	M
Thursday mornings, all I could do was think about next week.	N
Just tell me what's really going on.	N
She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother.	M
You must know which one it is, you sat there for over a year.	N
Anna Crowe, I am in love... in love I am.	M
Everyone that she plays with dies.	M
But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you.	N
You gave it to those Wall Street bastards?	M
You were the only audience I ever needed.	M
Sicker 'n' a dog, that's for sure.	M
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-	N
Then my lads, eternal life shall by ours!	N
Thus with a kiss I die.	M
Maybe he'll adopt me.	M
Why can't you all just die and leave me alone?	M
I'd rather fight with you than make love with anyone else.	M
Tell her what happened - Everything.	N
I guess I never looked at it like that before.	N
I'd keep my promises if I were you.	M
Of course, in Alabama the Tuscaloosa, but that's entirely irrelephant.	N
So, you know where I am...and now I know where you are, Anna Ivanovna.	M
And strip everything you don't need out of the planes.	N
There are some days when I actually love it.	N
Can you try and reach into my left jacket pocket?	N
That's right, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake!	N
I want to know everyone you've met for the last twenty years.	N
I don't, I didn't -- I met this girl earlier, Minnie Tyco?	N
Between take-off and landing, we have our time together, but that's all we get.	N
You know, you could have some really fun backyard get-togethers out here.	N
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.	M
Have I been sleeping later?	N
You don't have to tell me your secret if you don't want to.	N
Why don't y'all go back to your *own* cabin, if you want to play with C.W.	M
Mr. Jacks nods, heads for home.	N
Kirill, we don't kill little babies.	M
Where did you pick up that cheap trick?	M
You have taken your first step into a larger world.	N
I'd like to think that the last thing that went through his head, other than that bullet, was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.	M
My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.	M
Chicks cannot hold their smoke, dat's what it is.	M
I've always known I'll die alone.	M
Life is just a dream on the way to death.	M
I already got everything I need from you.	N
He's got to... All these years, runnin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him... Now we caught up...	N
No, but the boat has to be here somewhere!	N
Majorek, this is the greatest pianist in Poland, maybe the whole world.	M
Let's be able to say we were the ones who put peer pressure out to pasture.	N
Look at him... That's my brother god damnit.	M
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"?	M
He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.	N
Don't you just love New York in the fall?	M
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.	N
I know it's been a tough ordeal... with the trial and everything.	N
The broads're probably lining up right now, waiting for ol' Ty and his buddy Stump.	N
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and so inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?	M
Hasta la vista, baby.	M
And then, Black Beauty couldn't take it any longer and he finally did some of his own mounting.	M
If anyone needs me, I'll be in the Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen.	M
And now, your highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base...	M
Why don't you make like a tree, and get the fuck outta here?	M
We'll divide into teams.	N
Sixty thou a year, domestic.	N
The fool thought he had duplicated the moment of creation.	N
I think I just came... didn't you feel it?	M
You're the one who's in a hurry, aren't you?	N
Only bad witches are ugly.	M
I'm paying people just to wait for you.	N
I didn't come this far to be breakfast.	M
We're defending Brooke Windham, whose very wealthy husband was found shot to death in their Beacon Hill mansion.	N
Yeah, so did you, Bernstein.	N
The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --	N
All right buddy, that's it...	N
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.	N
I am Jack's smirking revenge.	M
Mr. Hammond, the phones are working.	M
That's the last time I leave you in charge.	M
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago.	N
She had lovers, but she saved that for marriage.	N
We're not gonna have a war, we're gonna have the appearance of a war.	M
You know how women lie.	M
Why, I'm so scared, I'm so scared, I'm so scared, wo-o-o!	M
Lately, your low self-esteem is just good common sense.	M
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.	N
Don't make a sound unless I say.	N
Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you.	N
We got a dollar ninety-eight, and you're laughing!	M
You are in a position unsuitable to give orders.	M
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?	N
Excuse me, but what are you talking about?	N
We're just good patriotic Americans like yourself.	N
We'll be comin' for you tonight, sister.	N
I consider myself a nerd.	M
That's my new favorite camel.	M
Is the colonel's underwear a matter of national security?	M
Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play.	N
"The multiplying villainies of nature do swarm upon him  disdaining fortune/with his brandish'd steel, which smoked with bloody execution...?	M
Look, it's okay for me to shit in the street, but *you* gotta use a toilet.	M
Sure don't look none too prosperous.	M
It does what ever the fuck I tell it to do!	N
If you don't mind, I'm gonna pass out.	M
What a strange person.	M
It's like throwing gasoline on a flame.	M
Monsieur LaPadite, to both your family and your cows I say: Bravo.	M
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.	N
Oh, God, I'm so ashamed!	M
Like I care about your shit.	N
He broke out of a metal hospital.	N
My boy's wicked smart.	M
I can't stand these things... it's like drinking coffee through a veil.	M
First time, shame on you.	N
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics.	M
I have therefore classified him a hostage of the war criminal known as Nero.	N
No matter what happened to you.	N
Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac.	M
But, if you decide to have the baby, then, at that very instant, when you're absolutely sure... tell him.	N
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours.	N
Oh, Nicky, I love you because you know such lovely people.	M
General, count me in.	M
These are fossilized bone fragments I've been able to study, gathered from the bomb site in Dallas...	N
Mom, this is so not the time to be yourself.	M
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.	N
I go to orgies, I catch everything...	N
I have worked out a little more of our plan.	N
Your dad has gone too far, Kirill.	N
It's better if we do this together.	N
I swear I will not kill anyone.	M
Tell me how old you are, Eddie.	N
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.	N
These men may be the only defense you've got.	N
My ass may be dumb, but I ain't no dumbass.	M
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.	N
Reject the basic assumptions of civilization, especially the importance of material possessions.	M
I've been monitoring their interaction.	N
That was some of the best flying I've seen to date - right up to the part where you got killed.	M
I could send five hundred men against that thing and they'd all come back in body bags.	N
I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.	M
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.	M
Don't make me take off my sunglasses!	M
We mortals have many weaknesses; we feel too much, hurt too much or too soon we die, but we do have the chance of love.	M
Quaffable, but uh... far from transcendent.	M
And so she walked out of our lives forever.	M
That's what I ask and that's what I care about, get out of my office.	N
Not in the mood, I guess.	N
Andy Dufresne - who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side.	M
Drink with your brains, that's our motto.	M
It's not the sort of responsibility the founding fathers might have recognized.	N
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!	N
You're too slow, old man.	M
And I think I stole that from the back of an in-flight magazine.	N
Come on, suck your finger, you'll be seeing mermaids everywhere!	N
It's Halloween, everyone's entitled to one good scare.	M
The guy was a total fruitcake.	N
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals.	M
Computer, open the second blast sectoot.	N
Next time, remind me to do this outside.	M
Sorry we were gone so long, but we had to pick up Hank!	M
You look so much more attractive when you're self- assured.	N
To get to the other side, and 1 point 772453851.	N
Alright, stand back you pedestrians, this ain't no automobile accident.	M
It's like War of the Worlds.	M
Sometimes it's a hard world for small things.	M
Well, I am the last person to persuade you, but don't do it blindly... if this is your decision, you must be prepared to face the consequences...	N
When somebody asks me a question, I tell them the answer.	M
This guy's a restraining order waiting to happen.	M
She's tapping Kara, and Kara knows you know me.	N
I'm gonna give you an L.A.P.D ass-whuppin'!	M
Why do they always run?	M
When it's ready, my body will just push it out.	M
How would I know, I mean he lies about everything anyway!	N
I can't wait to see afternoon.	N
And here I made you all hot and sweaty...	M
I don't think that there's anything worse than being ordinary.	M
Oh, God, get me out.	N
Behold, as a wild ass in the desert, go I forth to my work.	M
Schmucks are people too.	M
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead.	N
She kept yammering all the time, but her hips were doing all the talking.	M
Activate your weirding modules...	N
These are the first-born sons of Gotham City!	N
Bet the last place you ever go.	N
Death is only the beginning.	M
I can't run with you, Mickey!	N
Well, if it doesn't jell, it isn't aspic, and this ain't jellin'!	M
Have you seen a little dog?	N
Just open it up, let the woman out.	N
And then we all smiled, and it was a great minute.	N
Welcome to the real world.	M
You makin' a nigga fall hard, man...	M
Wipe your face before you get up Dean.	M
The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --	N
I was trying to keep you out of this.	N
She brings you good news.	N
Me, Grimlock, want to munch metal.	M
No, don't do that, I had a big lunch.	N
I don't give a flying handshake what your name is.	M
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.	N
If you piss in your pants, you only stay warm for so long.	M
Professor Marvel never guesses, he knows!	M
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.	M
My curiosity is killing me; what are you so rambunctious about tonight?	N
Taking out what you should never have put in.	N
Let's put the women and children to bed and go lookin' for dinner!	M
Logan... you renewed!	M
You didn't straighten the place up, did you?	N
OK, so we got a trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, these folks drive by, there's a high-speed pursuit, ends here and then this execution-type deal.	M
The Emperor's made a critical error, and the time for our attack has come.	M
Let it shine, shine, shine, All around the world!!	N
They've been shaking their ass for two minutes!	M
You think I did good?	N
She's a little pissed off right now but...	N
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills Guy.	M
Frank Wheeler, I think you're the most interesting person I've ever met.	M
Do not know how many more are in the vicinity but I am taking steps for another visitation.	N
I avoided capture by using your Mak'tar stealth haze.	M
hibb... hibbdy... Maybe I did die in the explosion, you know.	M
I told you, if you ever touch me again, I'll kill you.	M
I think it was a simple case of wanting to be a man again after all that abortion business.	N
There is no place for excuses when you are the LEADER!	M
I think we'd better run...	N
Cannot get good help these days.	N
I'll torture you so slowly, you'll think it's a career.	M
You make every day feel like kindergarten.	M
After fighting, everything else in your life got the volume turned down.	M
...And this man on the hill comes.	N
Thank you for talking about me behind my back - that'll be useful in court.	M
I got her back for you.	N
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left.	N
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget that I run a business?	M
'Cause they're sheep -- and the sheep get slaughtered.	N
You shouldn't be callin' people lousy little shrimps, Oscar, unless you're referrin' to the family resemblance in your brother here.	M
I'm just a half mile from here.	N
I think it's more like Banky's having a real problem with all things not hetero right about now.	M
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?	N
Mind where you shoot, boys!	N
What family he had tended to... not survive.	N
If your only faith is science, doctor, it may be you that's laid to rest.	M
John Connor... We gotta find this guy.	M
Forgive me, I'm blowing your mind.	M
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.	N
No way they could stop it.	N
And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.	N
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.	N
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?	N
You're not a tipsomaniac at your age?	M
Maybe we're at war with Norway?	M
It's what you are that's being denied and denied and denied in this kind of life.	N
There never was, and there never will be, another like you.	M
What kind of mother can't stand her own son?	M
With you as her mother her father could be anybody in Actors' Equity!	N
You stomp around like a forties drunk and you're a lousy shot.	N
So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me.	N
When I was in China on the All-American Ping Pong team, I just loved playing ping-pong with my Flexolite ping pong paddle.	M
Even in hell I get no respect.	M
The guide book was written by a bunch of lazy good-for-nothing Indian beggars!	M
Even entertaining the possibility of this for a minute has been exciting.	N
We ain't gonna bring Nike to their knees with some regional camel ad --	N
Well, to tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.	M
A person's body is his temple.	M
Everybody take your seatsl Col.Landa, Lt.Aldo, and Bridget are still together.	N
What is the point of living in L.A. if you're not in the movie business?	M
Life was sweet... For a minute.	M
Me and him's made friends.	N
It's not you I don't trust.	N
Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red light!	N
You are hanging on by a very thin thread and I dig that about you!	M
All I ever wanted was a single thing worth fighting for.	M
Fight on, fight on, dear old Muncie/Fight on, hoist the gold and blue/You'll be tattered, torn, and hurtin'/Once the Munce is done with you/Go... Eagles!	M
Yeah, turn it up!	N
An honest man is always in trouble, remember that Simon.	M
Ask Bianca who drove her home	N
You throw money around like it was money.	M
You don't wanna talk, tell me to fuck off...	N
It's the charming street urchin's face.	N
So there's no information on the street, which is how cases get made.	N
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.	M
Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you.	N
I feel like an idiot fainting in a stranger's office.	M
So help me I mean it!	N
What's wrong with being a large mammal?	M
No fire, I beg you.	N
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...	N
I just cannot believe any of this voodoo bullshit!	M
We have monitored a large explosion in your sector.	N
You gotta dollar -- You're a friend of mine!	N
Mission control to Chuck, come in...	N
That sex was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.	M
Don't give me any of that intelligent life crap, just give me something I can blow up	M
Why don't you take my oil and I'll fucking pay you?	N
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.	N
Just start with your name.	N
Issue a standing kill order on Jason Bourne, effective immediately.	M
This is Chicago as it exists today.	N
Your eyes can deceive you; don't trust them.	M
To avenge my father, I will turn you into killing machines.	N
