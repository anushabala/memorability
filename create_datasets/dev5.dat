I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...	N
You've been a bad girl, Grace!	M
What the hell you doin', Grace?	N
All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"!	N
I bet right now, you don't know if you want to kill me... or fuck me.	M
Women say they don't want to be taken like, really taken -- that's bullshit -- they do.	N
I was making time with your girl.	N
And here I made you all hot and sweaty...	M
A little advice about feelings kiddo; don't expect it always to tickle.	M
I mean there's someone besides your mother you've got to forgive.	N
Don King talks black, lives white and thinks green.	M
And now they got you up against George Foreman.	N
Ain't no Vietcong ever called me nigger.	M
You look like the heavyweight champion of pimps.	M
There's no "back" to take you to...	N
I'm Bruce Nolan with Eyewitness Nose... Eyewitness Nose... that's right!	M
Well, I guess that's the way life works, isn't it?	N
And that's the way the cookie crumbles.	M
Any word on the open anchor position, Jack?	N
Where can I get a cab back to town?	N
Well, he didn't say in so many words that ever since you started with that house you haven't turned in a decent piece of copy, but --	N
You've been taken to the cleaners, and you don't even know your pants are off.	M
With a few minor deviations I know exactly where every penny is going --	N
Dylan... until mommy gets back... whatever you do don't fall asleep.	M
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.	N
I am Ard... Supreme Leader of The Revolution and Next Ruler of The World.	M
You will go with him to the Queen's castle and steal the Loc-Nar.	N
There was no way I was gonna walk around this place with my dork hanging out!	M
I kept thinking I was going to run out of air, but my new body worked great.	N
If you were any less black, you'd be clear.	M
If you let them in here, they will kill you.	N
I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--	N
Don't tease me, you know what I do for a living.	M
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....	N
I'll go put these in some rubbing alcohol.	M
We haven't seen each other since high school.	N
Well, a son is a poor substitute for a lover.	M
She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.	N
We're always quickest to doubt people who have a reputation for being honest.	M
Look, this isn't much, but it might make you feel a little better.	N
She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother.	M
There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...	N
I think I must have one of those faces you can't help believing.	M
Well, if it doesn't jell, it isn't aspic, and this ain't jellin'!	M
This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.	N
I brought you nectarines cause the peaches were hard as rocks	M
And then we all smiled, and it was a great minute.	N
Like I said, it ain't me you gotta worry about.	M
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh?	N
Did not know who he was fuckin' with.	M
You're dancing on razor blades here.	M
Okay, maybe that's a good thing.	N
I said I'd die for them not you Come on!	M
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we?	N
Reckon you make me some biscuits.	M
Me and him's made friends.	N
I like them French fried potaters.	M
A shovel just makes too goddamned much racket.	M
By the way, how was it out there?	N
Ben, if you mixed drinks that way you mixed metaphors, you'd be out of a job...	M
Do either of you have any idea when they stopped using that site as a rifle range?	N
Son, you got a talent for stating the obvious.	M
Little greaser sonofabitch been running a goddarn bus service.	N
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.	N
No way they could stop it.	N
I wouldn't give you a gun if it were World War 3.	M
We go out, we find those damn snake things, we make 'em extinct.	N
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget that I run a business?	M
You know, a good cop will never let you know he knows you're full of shit.	M
Half a million dollars will always be missed.	M
I know the type, trust me on this.	N
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.	N
My ass may be dumb, but I ain't no dumbass.	M
That's why she's givin' up my money huh?	N
You can't trust Melanie but you can trust Melanie to be Melanie.	M
Don't you puke on my shoes Harry.	M
They say the fucking smog is the fucking reason you have such beautiful fucking sunsets.	M
The guy's been in town two days, and already he thinks he's David O. Fucking Selznick.	M
I got an idea for a movie.	M
The door from the patio, in back.	N
Where's Chili Palmer, where's Leo DeVoe... *where's* my fuckin' money?	M
Forget all the bullshit from before -- I don't even remember how it started.	N
I'm the guy who's telling you the way it is.	M
You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.	N
What is the point of living in L.A. if you're not in the movie business?	M
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?	N
But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.	N
I came here to rob you, but unfortunately I fell in love with you.	M
Just a matter of time, I suppose.	M
I always thought I knew the punchline.	N
She had lovers, but she saved that for marriage.	N
How can I stop talking about something that's so HUGE?	M
You look so much more attractive when you're self- assured.	N
Unfortunately, you don't have the balls to back up the actions of your huge cock.	M
Put it this way, God made up for what he did to Gumby with Ted here.	N
Won't stop until he finds it.	N
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.	N
I consider myself a nerd.	M
I already saw it once.	N
The future has taken root in the present.	M
But it'll take another, a greater king...	N
Good and evil, there never is one without the other.	M
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.	N
I gotta go break the news to Megan's friends about what's happened.	N
It does what ever the fuck I tell it to do!	N
Just call me Darth Balls... Bong.	M
This was a good idea, Lunchbox.	N
Are we gonna have a problem... again?	M
Will, what're we gonna do now?	N
Well what are you waiting for, bitch?	N
Neither did I. Shit, neither did the studio.	N
Hey, I wanted to go down, but I was waiting until I got to know her a little better.	N
I'm gonna finger-bang her tight little asshole / Finger-bang and tea-bag my balls / Where, where, in her mouth / Balls a-plenty in her mouth / Balls Balls Sweaty Balls	M
You'll have to be faster than Walt Flanagan's Dog to outrun the warrior gorillas, who hunt humans for sport, profit, and the occasional inter- species blow-job.	N
Dude, I think I just filled the cup.	M
These men are the leaders of a terrorist organization wanted for the abduction of a monkey.	N
So you want me to tell you the story of my life?	M
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story.	N
So it was, when I'd given up the search for vampires, that a vampire found me.	M
I think the very name of Paris brought a rush of pleasure to me that was extraordinary.	N
A little child she was, but also a fierce killer, now capable of the ruthless pursuit of blood with all a child's demanding.	M
...and finally, when I could stand it no longer, I stood in an empty desolate street and heard the sound of a child crying.	N
We are predators, Whose all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.	M
Your income from cotton alone will keep us in comfort for a century.	N
Tell me how it came to be that I am this... thing...	N
Do you want to die here?	M
I won't let it happen, okay?	M
After Lewton, you should've been next.	N
I got this feeling... a weird feeling.	M
You think I'm some sort of...	N
I knew I shoulda hit on Tammy in the pool that time.	M
I am... so close to puking, you don't wanna know.	N
Don't bother to scream.	M
We fell from grace together.	N
I'd keep my promises if I were you.	M
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind.	N
Who knocked up your sister?	M
Just 'cause you're beautiful, that doesn't mean that you can treat people like they don't matter.	M
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.	N
And I'm BACK IN THE GAME!	M
She's partial to Joey, not me	N
I guess in this society, being male and an asshole makes you worthy of our time.	M
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.	N
It's not everyday you find a girl who'll flash someone to get you out of detention.	M
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...	N
Watching that bitch violate my car doesn't count as a date.	M
So get your ass on hers by the end of the week.	N
Remove head from sphincter, then drive!	M
Ask Bianca who drove her home	N
Jesus Christ, that's Jason Bourne!	M
Get the asset out of there ...	N
Issue a standing kill order on Jason Bourne, effective immediately.	M
It's better if we do this together.	N
She could talk her way out of a sunburn.	M
Yeah, well, that's a Hazard of the jjj...	N
And we were dressed from head to toe in love... the only label that never goes out of style.	M
For the last five months I've been thinking that it's a huge mistake that you left Steve.	N
Yeah, it's all so hot three days in!	M
I let the sex go out of our marriage!	N
Just calling to make sure you aren't hanging from your shower rod.	M
Yes, the honeymoon to a romantic Mexican resort that I prepaid on my credit card to surprise the man who jilted me.	M
Well, if you change your minds, I know where we can get one hundred beef, seventy-five fish and twenty- five vegetarian meals.	N
It wasn't logic, it was love.	M
It's a once in a lifetime opportunity - so spare me a week of faux soul-searching and just say yes.	N
It's my lot in life to be surrounded by beautiful women.	M
Is a relationship saying his name fifty times more a day than my own?	M
It's more than that -- lately, I haven't been feeling a connection to --	N
Year after year, twenty-something women come to New York City in search of the two L's: labels and love.	M
I had told Louise to put Big in a place where I would never have to hear from him again.	N
Ever Thine, Ever Mine, Ever Ours.	M
Which is why I called them.	N
Here I am, you lucky people!	M
It's a test of skill.	N
Well... You can want in one hand and shit in the other, and see which one fills first.	M
Why, I'm so scared, I'm so scared, I'm so scared, wo-o-o!	M
Well, he's got about as much chance of one as of the other.	N
You left the cap off the toothpaste again.	M
Spat on the floor as I walked by.	N
To absent friends... To family.	M
You have the bridge, Commander.	N
You have the bridge... Mr. Troi.	M
Data, Worf, you're with me.	N
You're too slow, old man.	M
And you can't contact Starfleet.	N
I will always be puzzled by the human predilection for piloting vehicles at unsafe velocities.	M
I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior.	N
Ladies and gentlemen, and invited transgendered species...	M
Geordi, if you will come with me.	N
Can you learn to see in the dark, Captain?	M
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain.	N
You know, all things considered, Data, I think you have nicer eyes.	M
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level.	N
I think it's time to try some unsafe velocities.	M
No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy.	N
Some ideals are worth dying for, aren't they, Jean-Luc?	M
I have two arms and ten fingers.	N
Professor Marvel never guesses, he knows!	M
Well, well, well -- house guests, huh?	N
Unusual weather we're having, ain't it?	M
I'd be monarch of all I survey....	N
How about a little fire, Scarecrow?	M
Ah -- now we've got them!	N
A heart is not judged by how much you love; but by how much you are loved by others.	M
Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.	N
Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain.	M
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that?	N
I can barely hear my heart beating!	M
That's what the other man said.	N
I think I'll miss you most of all.	M
Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true!	N
Only bad witches are ugly.	M
She brings you good news.	N
He's not coming back.	M
If I had a horse...	N
Ask her the name of the first hospital.	N
Here I am, sitting in the center of a lot of wealth, the escalation in crime couldn't be better, and I'm not turning a damn nickel on it!	M
Then call this number -- 555-7617: tell the man "blue horseshoe loves Anacott Steel..." You scored, Buddy!	N
Sure went down the toilet with that ugly bitch.	M
Tell Mr. Ehrlich I've got important financial news!	N
You gonna tell me the difference between this guy and that guy is luck?	M
Use a stop loss so your downside is 50,000, and buy yourself a decent suit.	N
The most valuable commodity I know of is information.	M
'Cause they're sheep -- and the sheep get slaughtered.	N
We're all just one trade away from humility.	M
...things are so bad, even the liars are complaining.	N
Gutsiest move I ever saw, Mav.	M
I died enough for one night.	N
That was some of the best flying I've seen to date - right up to the part where you got killed.	M
Don't they ever stop migrating?	M
Did you find her all right?	N
Alimony is just another word for RAPE.	M
They had a very popular series together.	N
But the false promise of a new dawn usually leads to a most bloody sunset.	M
...remarkable that his 'Faith Factory' is being financed by an entire nation's indigestion.	N
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?	M
I wanted to write a book about the murder of a retired rock star.	N
Everyone that she plays with dies.	M
I went over to your place.	N
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.	N
I demand the sum... OF 1 MILLION DOLLARS.	M
I was therefore by definition only partially frozen.	N
That's not your mother, it's a man, baby!	M
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.	N
There's nothing as pathetic as an aging hipster.	M
You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight.	N
Au contraire baby, you can't resist me.	M
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.	N
You run the job, but I run the show.	M
There never was, and there never will be, another like you.	M
Peace and quiet is for libraries!	M
I - I don't know, Bill.	N
The bed looks like a dead animal act.	M
This you can't do in Times Square...	N
Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...	N
The atmosphere is very MacBeth-ish... what has, or is about to, happen?	M
Real diamonds in a wig, the world we live in.	M
They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...	N
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance!	N
I'll never forget this night as long as I live, and I'll never forget you for making it possible.	M
They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all.	N
Let's see if you bleed green.	M
Cannot get good help these days.	N
Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...	N
If you want to play with animals, Mr. Walsh, join the circus.	M
Or collected in the bladder to be expelled at a later time.	N
Even in hell I get no respect.	M
I go to orgies, I catch everything...	N
The last time I saw a pair of jugs that big, two hillbillies were blowing on them.	M
Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration.	N
Look, it's okay for me to shit in the street, but *you* gotta use a toilet.	M
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.	N
I think you're looking at him.	N
I came through that gate alone.	N
All right, Krueger... this time it's for keeps!	M
In the dream, she was standing in a room.	N
Kids... always a disappointment.	M
See a family resemblance?	N
You tell *Her Majesty* that if her husband were here he'd tell her to get out of the house and get some air into her lungs.	M
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.	N
No one should think themselves wiser than me!	M
I will not give him up to them.	N
Yeah, this is the haute cuisine of garments.	M
I'm glad to see you too, Sammy.	N
Majorek, this is the greatest pianist in Poland, maybe the whole world.	M
The moment Hitler invaded Russia, I knew we'd be all right.	N
Well, to tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.	M
The width of the arms of the Star must be one centimetre.	N
I don't think, he can't...	N
I'll tell you the greatest regret of my life: I let my love go.	M
Let's make some fuckin' money, folks.	M
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery - Johns Hopkins, University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center.	M
You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?	N
Well, Clarice - have the lambs stopped screaming?	M
Then why not take your case file?	N
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.	M
Billy wants to change, too, Clarice.	N
I graduated from UVa, Captain; it's not exactly a charm school.	M
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?	N
You replaced Scott with a lesbian?	M
If you're lying to me, I'll be back!	M
We're different parts of a lot of different people.	N
As a matter of fact, a small tropical island, in the South Pacific, about 300 nautical miles south-southwest of Fiji.	N
Speak into the microphone, squid brain!	M
Have you seen a little dog?	N
Fear causes hesitation, and hesitation will cause your worst fears to come true.	M
If you project weakness, you draw aggression... that's how people get hurt.	N
Welcome to Sea World, Kid.	M
Twenty-seven banks in three years.	N
You gonna jump or jerk off?	M
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?	N
I've been in love with you since I was eleven, and the shit won't go away.	M
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.	N
All's fair in love and basketball.	M
I can't stand these things... it's like drinking coffee through a veil.	M
Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.	N
It is infuriating that your unhappiness does not turn to fat!	M
When you start to eat like this something is the matter.	N
Do you know what these things cost over here?	M
It was our money and we want it back.	N
Good luck on your important thing.	N
When it's ready, my body will just push it out.	M
I kept one of their menus last time we were here.	N
We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.	M
Shh, Shh, I can't tell you now.	N
I'm sorry I had to fight in the middle of your Black Panther party.	M
...which must be out west somewhere, 'cause she made it all the way to California.	N
When I was in China on the All-American Ping Pong team, I just loved playing ping-pong with my Flexolite ping pong paddle.	M
Sometimes, I guess there just aren't enough rocks.	M
And cause I was a gazillionaire, and I liked doin it so much, I cut that grass for free.	M
...wondering if I could come down to Savannah to see her, and that's what I'm doing here.	N
Mama always had a way of explaining things so I could understand them.	M
Anyway, I guess you could say me and Momma was on our own.	N
That's all I have to say about that.	M
Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play.	N
Unicron, my master... with this, I shall make you my slave.	M
We've got to get a new travel agent.	M
Don't worry, I'm not coming after you.	N
We can't hold out forever Kup, but we *can* give them one *humongous* repair bill.	M
Then we've got to trust in ourselves, and no matter what they odds, destroy Unicron.	N
I don't have to explain my so called violation to you or anyone...	N
Come on down Autobrat!	M
I should run things.	N
Me, Grimlock, want to munch metal.	M
Maybe they make me king, too!	N
And you're not going to screw that up.	N
Since when is LAPD working for the Feebs?	M
Both of whom were in the exotic-substances business...	N
You don't wanna talk, tell me to fuck off...	N
If you open that trunk, they go inside.	M
I'm just a half mile from here.	N
I'll take care of the check.	N
Larry, stop pointin' that fuckin' gun at my Dad!	M
So the man can turn out a hinge in less than a minute, why the long story?	M
That's what I ask and that's what I care about, get out of my office.	N
Stern, if this factory ever produces a shell that can actually be fired, I'll be very unhappy.	M
If you shoot without thinking, you go to prison and I get paid, that's how it works.	N
You know, corporate accounting is sure as hell gonna notice $305,326.13, Michael!	M
Well, I didn't think you would sleep with a guy like Lumbergh!	N
What am I gonna do with 40 subscriptions to Vibe?	M
I'm going to take the blame for it, I decided.	N
Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?	N
You stay away from my wife, my life, my home, and my skunk!	M
I know it's been a tough ordeal... with the trial and everything.	N
And even governments don't go to war with him.	N
I believe "shaved" is the expression.	M
You mean like, strip strip?	N
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.	N
This one time, at band camp, I stuck a flute in my pussy.	M
Neither country proverb nor King's command could keep me from the woods, today.	M
No doubt they're as foul as the stuff you set on your table....	N
Mr. Hammond, the phones are working.	M
There's the Visitor's Center.	N
Jesus Christ, what happened?	M
Don't worry Jennie.	N
I don't think you should tell her she doesn't have blood...	M
It's too late in the game to be having these problems, David.	N
Glad to be weirdly close.	M
I don't know what I'm doing.	M
Well, we'll build it over time together.	N
My eyes still hurt from reading that movie.	M
Ronnie, come on baby, we gotta go.	N
When it looked like they could get twenty-five years to life in prison just for skimming a casino, sick or no fuckin' sick you knew people were going to get clipped.	M
And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay?	N
Take this stiff and pound it up your fucking ass!	M
Look at this, twenty fuckin' paints in a row.	N
Tell that fuckin' Pepe if he's switching stones on us, he'd better take a fucking camel back to Nigeria.	M
Now, on top of everything else, I gotta make sure no one fucks around with the Golden Jew.	M
I mean, he was already in Vegas a couple of years and he had the fuckin' place clocked.	N
I want you to exit this guy off the premises, I want you to exit him off his feet and I want you to use his head to open the fucking door.	M
...put Artie Piscano, the underboss of KC, in charge of making sure nobody skimmed the skim.	N
How the fuck can you grin?	M
What do I give a fuck?	N
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.	N
Take this one and stick it up your sister's ass!	M
We are the luckiest sons of bitches in the world, you know that?	M
Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you.	N
So, you wanna go to a real party?	M
That's one of the good things about Paris: lots of girls willing to take their clothes off.	M
When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.	N
You shine up like a new penny.	M
Ain't you boys ever rowed before?	N
The last thing I need is another picture of me looking like a porcelain doll.	M
Rose is displeased... what to do?	M
You wanted to see the propellers?	N
He died in the town he was born in, and never did see it.	N
You gonna cut her meat for her too there, Cal?	M
Come and get me, you son of a bitch!	M
If I go any faster this thing will turn into a flying Cuisinart and we'll all be diced into oblivion!	M
Which means I have to go a lot of places to pay my debts and borrow money to keep it going....	N
I've always known I'll die alone.	M
What... Bones, what are we going to sing?	N
I believe I have found a faster way.	N
Why does God need a starship?	M
We'll play it your way.	N
Shall I clear all this away?	N
I suppose a smaller-caliber pistol would have to fire baby teeth.	M
As long as you have that, they know where you are.	N
Oh, dear God, it's growing bigger!	M
The Batbook is pecking at his eyes!	N
Keep your damn filthy bones outta my mouth.	M
I'm through bein' their garbage boy.	N
Then my lads, eternal life shall by ours!	N
I did not have to go as far as I was prepared to go, but I was prepared to go all the way.	M
You'd make a good poker player, kid.	M
It was nice to see you again, Ally.	N
There are no survivors.	N
My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.	M
I shall trade you the Compass, if you will help me... to find this.	N
Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor.	N
Every man has a price he will willingly accept, even for what he hoped never to sell.	M
Your authority as governor, your influence in London, and your loyalty to the East India Trading Company.	N
She's only a ship, mate.	M
The property you want that he possesses.	N
Who told them of the key?	N
You're not a tipsomaniac at your age?	M
I feel like an idiot fainting in a stranger's office.	M
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.	N
I don't give a flying handshake what your name is.	M
Which is not a helluva lot to sink your teeth into.	N
In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.	M
You have taken your first step into a larger world.	N
I have a very bad feeling about this.	M
Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease.	M
I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.	N
And now, your highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base...	M
Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!	N
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.	M
Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up...	N
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi; you're my only hope.	M
There are still two more of them out there!	N
If there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.	M
Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off!	N
One thing's for sure, we're all gonna be a lot thinner.	M
We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.	N
The Force is strong with this one.	M
There'll be no escape for the princess this time.	M
I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.	N

Wouldn't it be great if wars could be fought just by the assholes who started them?	M
I don't mean any disrespect, sir, but you'd be better off just letting me go.	N

Put these clothes on!	N
I just can't see God putting a gift like that in the hands of a man who would kill a child.	M
You're going to have a few hours of quiet time now, so you can reflect on what you did to Del.	N
Seeing a man die isn't enough for you, you gotta be close enough to smell his nuts cook?	M
Nothing's hurt so far but your pride...and nobody need ever know about that except the people in this room.	N
I guess sometimes the past just catches up with you, whether you want it to or not.	M

Even if it's just banging its head against a rock.	N
She kept yammering all the time, but her hips were doing all the talking.	M
I agree with you that you don't know what you're talking about.	N
I may be young, but Doc, I can tell you that I'm very immature.	M

I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.	N
It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Cook.	N
I know it starts with a birth certificate...	N
How does it feel to know you're about to die?	M
Father, will you please explain what's going on?	N
Finger's gonna kill me.	M
I'm late as it is...	N
We don't take anything seriously, unless it's on a hard drive.	M
They found the weapon with Teddy's blood on it and their fingerprints.	N
It's a hard world for little things.	M
Bring them all down here to the kitchen.	N
No, Brother; I resigned only yesterday.	N
Child... You were looking for love, Ruby, in the only foolish way you knew how.	M
Ruby, I lost the love of my son -- I've found it with you all.	N
They abide, and they endure.	M

Man of my age needs a little snort in the morning, heat the boilers.	M
This mornin' I was talkin' to this stranger up at the boardinghouse.	N
They've been shaking their ass for two minutes!	M

Apparently there must be a lot about show business I don't understand.	N

Did he actually call himself "the talent"?	M
You gotta be kidding me.	M
Are you both from around here?	N
We've had our people looking everywhere for Him.	N
I feel like I'm Han Solo, and you're Chewie, and she's Ben Kenobi, and we're in that fucked-up bar.	M
...and now you're telling me that I'm supposed to take you somewhere, and you don't even know where it is?	N
Your hard-on for smiting has prevented us from negotiating what should be the relatively simple matter of catching or staying on a bus.	M
And even though it was years ago, there's not a day that goes by that I don't wonder what went wrong.	N
Glick's the kind of asshole that would bless his own clubs for a better game.	M

Like I told ya, all I saw was sand.	N
How are my boys, Bill?	N
Starla, get the hell out of here!	N
Open the door, Jellybean	M
You got school tomorrow.	N
Grant looks like a squid, don't know where he's gonna hide... Seaworld maybe.	M
And Wally and me, we also saw him that night, with mud all over his slacks.	N
Your gun is digging into my hip.	M
He broke out of a metal hospital.	N
If I'm not back in five minutes... just wait longer.	M
As soon as I find the white pigeon, you're paid!	N

I found a broken gasket from space.	M
Victor, this isn't the way to --	N
