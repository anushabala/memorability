But what kind of addict would need all these coconut husks and crushed honeydew rinds?	N
Is this not a reasonable place to park?	M
We're just good patriotic Americans like yourself.	N
You people voted for Hubert Humphrey, and you killed Jesus.	M
This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!	N
Well, I guess you're about ready, eh?	N
You're my best friend, and I don't even like you.	M
Whoever wrote this episode should DIE.	M

I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but..	N

A month ago, he ate my sandwich.	N
I see you've managed to get your shirt off.	M
Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...	N
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills Guy.	M
Computer, we're going to need some privacy... Close blast section 29 please.	N
Could you possibly try NOT to hit EVERY SINGLE ONE?	M
By Grapthar's hammer... what a savings.	M
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.	N

Now get some sleep, I may wish to have sex again before we eat breakfast.	M
If they reach the island, I want you to discourage them from getting any further.	N
What is it that your worried about, looking bad at the P.T.A?	M
Maybe Annabelle deserves to find out who really broke up her family.	N
I'm sorry you're sick.	M
I saw her in the shower!	N
Now that's enough fear for either one of us to kill the other.	N
What... you didn't really think we'd kill the fuckin' koala bear, now did ya?	M
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...	N
You got to shave before you leave the house in a dress like that... and I don't mean your legs.	M
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left.	N
hibb... hibbdy... Maybe I did die in the explosion, you know.	M
Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...	N

She ransacked her own room, and I fell for it!	M

My son, we're pilgrims in an unholy land.	M
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.	N
Does anyone understand a word I'm saying here?	M
What has the old fool got himself into now?	N
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics.	M
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-	N
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.	M
Oh, look, look, there's that ... that's -that's my old house.	N
That sex was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.	M
Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault.	N
I'd just become an investigator when I came across Sammy.	N
Maybe cause I repped him here.	N
About as subtle as a cockroach crawlin' across a white rug!	M
They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.	N
Can you look destiny in the eye without flinching?	M
You won't stop him with bullets or knives.	N
Life is just a dream on the way to death.	M
I just wish I understood what they were telling me.	N
I will not touch the white man's poison; his drugs, his liquor, his swine, his women.	M
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.	N

A Muslim must be strikingly upright; an outstanding example so that those in the darkness can see the power of the light.	M
But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you.	N
Erica, you are a woman to love.	M
I can do it by the way.	N
Harry, your heart attack could be the best thing that's ever happened to me!	M
And if someone like me doesn't write it, where they gonna get it?	N
Schmucks are people too.	M
These are for you to give me when you apologize.	M
I think you can expect just about anything right now.	N
How great is it for you that im not intimidated by your brilliance?	M
There's something radically wrong with the idea that no one loves you.	N
That's really not going to help.	M
I know, nobody's luck lasts forever.	N
You don't walk off the roof of a building, without leaving something behind.	M
So I took things into my own hands and I found a way out.	N
My boy's wicked smart.	M
Fuck you, you fat fuck.	N
Hey, let's get off our motha's, afterall, I just got off yours!	M
" But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back.	N
I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.	N
I can't be worrying about that shit.	N
That rug really tied the room together.	M
Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--	N
H-hey, this is a private residence, man!	M
That gives me a very secure feeling.	N
In your wisdom you took him, Lord.	N
At least I'm housebroken.	M
So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain.	N
Where's the fucking money Lebowski?	M
Or maybe forfeit it to us--	N
They're gonna kill that poor woman.	M
Dude's car got a little dinged up--	N
Walter, I love you, but sooner or later, you're going to have to face the fact you're a goddamn moron.	M
And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.	N
Shut the fuck up, Donny.	M
How much they offer you?	N
I kiss you and you say "yuck"?	M
Can I get back to you, Worf?	N
I'm not letting go of him!	M

We can hold them off a long time... once we get there...	N
White Russian, no ice, no vodka... hold the Kahlua.	M
And the cat came back, the very next day...	N
The pool on the roof must have a leak.	M
I don't play well with others.	M
It's cool, I'm just looking.	N
I kinda feel like God.	M
But for what, you ask?	N
I hope you don't screw like you type.	M
You couldn't find your dick in a windstorm.	M
What are you, Jimmy Olsen, cub reporter for the Daily Asshole?	M
Of course, in Alabama the Tuscaloosa, but that's entirely irrelephant.	N
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey!	M
Goddamn, motherfucker got blood all over my best clown suit.	M
A reality check courtesy of my boot in your ass.	N

We are grateful for the time we have been given.	M
What manner of spectacle has caught your attention so splendidly?	N
These men may be the only defense you've got.	N
My scrotum is longer than my penis.	M
Yeah, she's really worried about Bruce.	N
I gave you a baby tonight.	M
You can make money fast gambling.	N
May the forks be with us.	M
Not bad for a normal guy!	N
I'm gonna nail your ass!	M
I'm a hunka-hunka burninnnnn' love!	N
No matter what happened to you.	N
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!	M
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.	N
They're never gonna let you perform naked, I asked!	M
I don't know about what happened... because once you start writing, it ALL becomes fiction.	M
You express nothing but banalities and, formally speaking, are unable to construct a single compelling sentence.	N
Who would waste time killing you... besides me?	N
Can't rain all the time...	M
You go to hell, you pervert!	N
Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red light!	N
Oh, I don't like to be beside the seaside...	M
Then I suggest you go home and do the same.	N
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man.	N

Come to see the show?	M
Did you hear about Dode?	N
Maybe I'll just sit here and bleed at you.	M

We have just lost cabin pressure.	M
What's this all about, Tyler?	N
Now, a question of etiquette - as I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?	M
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.	N
You're the worst thing that's ever happened to me.	M

Look, Simon, I made love to your mother about half an hour ago, and now I'm beginning to think that maybe it wasn't such a good idea.	M

That's right, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake!	N

The man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks.	M
So Andy started writing a letter a week, just like he said.	N

I beat you, you old bitch!	M
Mr. Jacks nods, heads for home.	N
I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on Moral Abuses.	M
