Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...	N
Go on and read it, John, and then start socking!	N
I - I don't know, Bill.	N
All I know is... you're beautiful.	M
If there's anything around here more important than my ego, I want it caught and shot now!	M
Hang on tightly, let go lightly.	M
What virus are we talking about, Dad?	N
It was our money and we want it back.	N
I'll have to re-energize.	N
Can I go forward when my heart is here?	N
Au contraire baby, you can't resist me.	M
The first and most important rule of gun-running is: Never get shot with your own merchandise.	M
I always thought I knew the punchline.	N
These men are the leaders of a terrorist organization wanted for the abduction of a monkey.	N
And I'd gladly stand up; next to you and defend her still today.	N
Mmm, I'm a little bit lonely these days	M
You'd make a good poker player, kid.	M
L.A.P.D., I mean San Angeles P.D.	N
She did it because she got off on it, she did it for fun.	N
The two hours after school and before The Rockford Files, three days in a row.	N
See this is why we're not watching TV, people become obsessed.	M
I mean, he was already in Vegas a couple of years and he had the fuckin' place clocked.	N
Why'd you have to get us into this, Foxy?	N
NOBODY'S GONNA PUT ME TO SLEEP!	N
Well, kiddo, I thought you outgrew superstition.	M
I have a special surprise for you, Mommy!	M
Sammy, opening for David Brenner is a fine gig.	N
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?	N
Don't matter what kin' either.	N
Now, on top of everything else, I gotta make sure no one fucks around with the Golden Jew.	M
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.	N
Knowing what you've got, knowing what you need, knowing what you can do without - That's inventory control.	M
Captain, shall we raise our shields?	N
Mrs. Peel, you're needed.	M
Goddamn, these people are confusing.	M
But I knew if anyone could straighten them out, you could.	N
Don't worry Jennie.	N
Cause I don't forgive you, I don't forgive you for dying.	N
Joe College strikes out.	M
We fell from grace together.	N
I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.	N
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.	N
Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up...	N
Nobody appreciates that kind of integrity anymore... the grain, the gritty look you get.	N
Hey, fuck him, let's eat this thing.	N
You used to ride with that guy?	M
I was making time with your girl.	N
They abide, and they endure.	M
Don't be a fool!	N
My eyes still hurt from reading that movie.	M
Well, I am the last person to persuade you, but don't do it blindly... if this is your decision, you must be prepared to face the consequences...	N
Does my inner child need a spanking?	M
I'd be monarch of all I survey....	N
and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.	N
Yeah - I have that effect on people.	M
I don't think you should tell her she doesn't have blood...	M
I guess I'm just no good?	N
Trying to get something real by telling yourself stories is a trap.	M
You stay away from my wife, my life, my home, and my skunk!	M
Let's snuff the sucka.	M
I'm sorry I had to fight in the middle of your Black Panther party.	M
This is the coolest thing I have ever seen.	M
I promise, that one day, everything's going to be better for you.	M
Billy, take the radio, leave the rest.	N
You'd be surprised about what you can get, if you ask for it the right way.	M
Miss Winston, EVERYBODY has a secret face!	M
Even if it's just banging its head against a rock.	N
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu.	N
I don't think I'll ever dry out.	M
Stern, if this factory ever produces a shell that can actually be fired, I'll be very unhappy.	M
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....	N
Come with me if you want to live!	M
We get to go home at 7:55.	N
I don't think this is the lightning you're looking for.	M
Anyway, I guess you could say me and Momma was on our own.	N
I just love the feel of tuck and roll upholstery.	N
We've been after this cocksucker for a long time, and tonight we're gonna get him.	N
Oh, you amuse me, Roy, but I'm the only woman in America born after World War II that thinks astrology's a crock of shit.	M
It woulda been more humane to stake me down and leave me to the crows.	N
It's going to be a long spring.	M
Look at this: an entire generation of Cinderellas and there's no glass slipper.	M
You know, all things considered, Data, I think you have nicer eyes.	M
I sawed the main beam in half.	N
Oh, man, this isn't happening, it only thinks its happening.	M
There are some mistakes you cannot risk when you have children.	M
Just going to the kitchen to get some food, then I'm going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins.	M
What the hell you doin', Grace?	N
Mal shoots him in the head, turns back.	N
Only second chance I know, is the chance to make the same mistake twice.	M
What do I have to do to prove to you that I'm not a killer?	M
where's the happy little tire swing?	M
Come on, Louise, don't blow it.	M
Well, I guess that's the way life works, isn't it?	N
Here she stopped and, closing her eyes, took a deep breath of the flower-scented air of the broad expanse around her.	N
Guess old Melissa found what she was looking for.	M
His name is the Count De Rochefort.	N
Don't they ever stop migrating?	M
I'm sure it won't be that hard.	N
You weren't getting out of buying those beers that easy.	N
This kind of murder...	N
We've got to get bail.	N
Look kid, why don't you go out and win a few races, then come back and see me.	N
I now declare this bridge open!	M
And what do you think you're going to do?	N
Your partner told me he was under the weather.	N
And I'm BACK IN THE GAME!	M
Come on up and watch TV.	M
Oh, I think we're going to have several.	N
Because I can get into this vault in half an hour.	N
She's a good woman, Louise.	N
I'm supposed to install a firewall on his system-	N
I want you to exit this guy off the premises, I want you to exit him off his feet and I want you to use his head to open the fucking door.	M
I will not give him up to them.	N
Don't come back, either.	N
You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.	N
I shall trade you the Compass, if you will help me... to find this.	N
No doubt they're as foul as the stuff you set on your table....	N
If there's one thing this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have it.	M
That's the nice thing about them.	N
Well, you didn't think I forgot about you, did you?	M
Shit on my dick, or blood on my knife?	M
No -- don't you see -- crawling --	N
You drop this bombshell on me.	N
I'm not working for any other paper!	N
A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.	N
Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?	N
Bring in that floating fat man, the Baron!	M
You just stay in the car and watch and be ready.	N
He should join the Marines, they could make something out of him.	N
I'm surprised you're available.	N
What are you gunna do about it up in your fucking high window with your goddamn binoculars?	M
You're in the middle of a police station.	N
Mr. President, I have come to speak on behalf of the accused.	N
How are we going to explain to Brick Top that his fight isn't going to .	N
We are here for your protection and safety.	N
Inside the packet you'll find a clearly worked out severance package.	N
So what's this money deal you were talking about?	N
It's not contaminated, you don't even know what that word means.	M
You know, a good cop will never let you know he knows you're full of shit.	M
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?	N
Well, I think we should just make our delivery as soon as possible, don't you?	N
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.	N
Nothing is permanent, not even death.	M
I'm not sure I agree with you a hundred percent on your police work, there, Lou.	M
Yeah, well, that's a Hazard of the jjj...	N
We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.	N
We've got to get a new travel agent.	M
Who would like to buy some aspirin?	M
The Batbook is pecking at his eyes!	N
Well... You can want in one hand and shit in the other, and see which one fills first.	M
It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-	N
In the future, when a woman is crying like that, she isn't having any fun.	M
See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.	N
I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.	N
I'd like to kill the freaking guy who broke this mirror.	M
Put these clothes on!	N
Grab the shovel, Harold.	M
So you can take us to St. Rose.	N
Sleep is for the weak Mr. President.	M
Tell me your last name.	N
Kids - 10 seconds of joy, 30 years of misery.	M
Just tell me what's really going on.	N
She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother.	M
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.	M
A toast to my big brother George: The richest man in town.	M
I've always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.	M
Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!	N
You must know which one it is, you sat there for over a year.	N
Everyone that she plays with dies.	M
No, no, Marvin, it's fine really.	N
You were the only audience I ever needed.	M
Sicker 'n' a dog, that's for sure.	M
Then my lads, eternal life shall by ours!	N
Thus with a kiss I die.	M
I'd always had nightmares, but now the ghosts didn't wait for me to sleep.	M
Maybe he'll adopt me.	M
Why can't you all just die and leave me alone?	M
I'd rather fight with you than make love with anyone else.	M
I guess I never looked at it like that before.	N
Aren't we saying cocaine is more potent than our Constitution?	N
I shall not be caged like some animal	N
So, you know where I am...and now I know where you are, Anna Ivanovna.	M
And strip everything you don't need out of the planes.	N
Did you ever try to run in high heels?	N
There are some days when I actually love it.	N
I want to know everyone you've met for the last twenty years.	N
I don't, I didn't -- I met this girl earlier, Minnie Tyco?	N
Go ahead... make my millenium.	M
Why is it I can't get it on with the good guys?	M
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.	M
Yeah, this is the haute cuisine of garments.	M
You never know, lightning could strike.	M
Why don't y'all go back to your *own* cabin, if you want to play with C.W.	M
Kirill, we don't kill little babies.	M
You have taken your first step into a larger world.	N
My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.	M
It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy.	N
Chicks cannot hold their smoke, dat's what it is.	M
I've always known I'll die alone.	M
I already got everything I need from you.	N
Hey, porky pig, I hope you get molested.	M
He's got to... All these years, runnin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him... Now we caught up...	N
No, but the boat has to be here somewhere!	N
Look at him... That's my brother god damnit.	M
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"?	M
Don't you just love New York in the fall?	M
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.	N
My husband's dead, isn't he?	N
The broads're probably lining up right now, waiting for ol' Ty and his buddy Stump.	N
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and so inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?	M
Hasta la vista, baby.	M
Look Ah this isn't really necessary.	N
And then, Black Beauty couldn't take it any longer and he finally did some of his own mounting.	M
If anyone needs me, I'll be in the Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen.	M
And now, your highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base...	M
The Indian used campfires.	N
We'll divide into teams.	N
We have had security problems and to cut a long story short, I need another seven million Euros lost in the books.	N
Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack.	M
Sixty thou a year, domestic.	N
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!	N
The fool thought he had duplicated the moment of creation.	N
I'm not running -- not from you.	N
She's only a ship, mate.	M
If this is all a dream, why can't there be more girls?	M
I think I just came... didn't you feel it?	M
Tell him I couldn't read his lips.	N
Only bad witches are ugly.	M
I'm paying people just to wait for you.	N
I didn't come this far to be breakfast.	M
This maniac should be wearing a number, not a badge.	M
Yeah, so did you, Bernstein.	N
Go ahead... take your best shot, motherfucker!	M
The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --	N
Bring in the logic probe!	M
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.	N
Mr. Hammond, the phones are working.	M
That's the last time I leave you in charge.	M
Yes, things are going quite well.	N
She had lovers, but she saved that for marriage.	N
We're not gonna have a war, we're gonna have the appearance of a war.	M
Why, I'm so scared, I'm so scared, I'm so scared, wo-o-o!	M
Lately, your low self-esteem is just good common sense.	M
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.	N
Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you.	N
We got a dollar ninety-eight, and you're laughing!	M
Why did I kill all the others?	N
You are in a position unsuitable to give orders.	M
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?	N
Excuse me, but what are you talking about?	N
We'll be comin' for you tonight, sister.	N
I consider myself a nerd.	M
That's my new favorite camel.	M
Is the colonel's underwear a matter of national security?	M
Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play.	N
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.	M
Look, it's okay for me to shit in the street, but *you* gotta use a toilet.	M
All you need is love, John Lennon, smart man, shot in the back very sad.	M
Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.	M
Sure don't look none too prosperous.	M
It does what ever the fuck I tell it to do!	N
<u>All</u> restaurants are now Taco Bell.	N
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.	N
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?	M
Mark, this isn't some kind of jo...	N
Monsieur LaPadite, to both your family and your cows I say: Bravo.	M
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.	N
Oh, God, I'm so ashamed!	M
Like I care about your shit.	N
Hey, Cherita... want a cigarette?	N
They went with someone who had more theme-park experience.	M
I took the bread.	N
Repeat drunk drivers, and I'm gonna get 'em all off.	N
He broke out of a metal hospital.	N
I can't stand these things... it's like drinking coffee through a veil.	M
Go Back to China, bitch.	M
Now more than ever we need the Jedi.	M
Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac.	M
But, if you decide to have the baby, then, at that very instant, when you're absolutely sure... tell him.	N
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours.	N
Oh, Nicky, I love you because you know such lovely people.	M
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels!	M
These are fossilized bone fragments I've been able to study, gathered from the bomb site in Dallas...	N
Mom, this is so not the time to be yourself.	M
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.	N
I go to orgies, I catch everything...	N
Your dad has gone too far, Kirill.	N
It's better if we do this together.	N
I swear I will not kill anyone.	M
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.	N
I was 27 years old the first time I died.	M
I've been monitoring their interaction.	N
Stick 'em in the bushes for now.	N
That was some of the best flying I've seen to date - right up to the part where you got killed.	M
We didn't even know she had been taken hostage.	N
I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.	M
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.	M
It won't affect me, I'm already a woman.	M
The east side is always faster.	N
I'm not dying in a fucking rat maze!	M
Don't make me take off my sunglasses!	M
We mortals have many weaknesses; we feel too much, hurt too much or too soon we die, but we do have the chance of love.	M
Quaffable, but uh... far from transcendent.	M
That's what I ask and that's what I care about, get out of my office.	N
I got all this information illegally.	N
Drink with your brains, that's our motto.	M
It's not the sort of responsibility the founding fathers might have recognized.	N
You're too slow, old man.	M
And I think I stole that from the back of an in-flight magazine.	N
Come on, suck your finger, you'll be seeing mermaids everywhere!	N
I like to understand what I'm shown.	M
It's Halloween, everyone's entitled to one good scare.	M
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals.	M
The perfect nuclear family.	N
We can't let those gang-bangers get away, man...	N
Sorry we were gone so long, but we had to pick up Hank!	M
You look so much more attractive when you're self- assured.	N
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothin'.	M
To get to the other side, and 1 point 772453851.	N
It's like War of the Worlds.	M
Extra Cheese is two dollars.	M
When somebody asks me a question, I tell them the answer.	M
This guy's a restraining order waiting to happen.	M
I'm gonna give you an L.A.P.D ass-whuppin'!	M
Why do they always run?	M
That's a lot of fish.	M
Once or twice more and we're going to be dead in space.	N
When it's ready, my body will just push it out.	M
How would I know, I mean he lies about everything anyway!	N
I can't wait to see afternoon.	N
And here I made you all hot and sweaty...	M
I'm not jello!	N
This was a good idea, Lunchbox.	N
Behold, as a wild ass in the desert, go I forth to my work.	M
She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!	N
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead.	N
She kept yammering all the time, but her hips were doing all the talking.	M
Activate your weirding modules...	N
It's time we were away.	N
These are the first-born sons of Gotham City!	N
Bet the last place you ever go.	N
Death is only the beginning.	M
This is simply a reflection of my appreciation.	N
Well, if it doesn't jell, it isn't aspic, and this ain't jellin'!	M
Have you seen a little dog?	N
And then we all smiled, and it was a great minute.	N
I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.	N
Welcome to the real world.	M
You makin' a nigga fall hard, man...	M
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.	N
I was trying to keep you out of this.	N
She brings you good news.	N
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.	N
Me, Grimlock, want to munch metal.	M
No, don't do that, I had a big lunch.	N
You ever feel as if your mind had started to erode?	M
Never fear, Smith is here.	M
Depends on the woman I marry.	N
I was responsible... in some way...	N
Professor Marvel never guesses, he knows!	M
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.	M
My curiosity is killing me; what are you so rambunctious about tonight?	N
A toast, to the end of the world.	M
Let's put the women and children to bed and go lookin' for dinner!	M
I've been in love with you since I was eleven, and the shit won't go away.	M
You didn't straighten the place up, did you?	N
OK, so we got a trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, these folks drive by, there's a high-speed pursuit, ends here and then this execution-type deal.	M
Let it shine, shine, shine, All around the world!!	N
They've been shaking their ass for two minutes!	M
She's a little pissed off right now but...	N
Frank Wheeler, I think you're the most interesting person I've ever met.	M
Do not know how many more are in the vicinity but I am taking steps for another visitation.	N
I told you, if you ever touch me again, I'll kill you.	M
I think it was a simple case of wanting to be a man again after all that abortion business.	N
Not interrupting anything, I hope.	N
I think we'd better run...	N
Cannot get good help these days.	N
I'll torture you so slowly, you'll think it's a career.	M
Well I don't know I mean that's pretty severe.	N
...And this man on the hill comes.	N
We have to make it down to the bottom.	N
Thank you for talking about me behind my back - that'll be useful in court.	M
I got her back for you.	N
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget that I run a business?	M
'Cause they're sheep -- and the sheep get slaughtered.	N
I'm just a half mile from here.	N
I think it's more like Banky's having a real problem with all things not hetero right about now.	M
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?	N
Mind where you shoot, boys!	N
If your only faith is science, doctor, it may be you that's laid to rest.	M
Forgive me, I'm blowing your mind.	M
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.	N
No way they could stop it.	N
Hey, what's wrong with Meat Loaf's butt?	M
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.	N
We have to shut them down...	N
...aced those guys that tried to kill us!	N
You're not a tipsomaniac at your age?	M
Maybe we're at war with Norway?	M
I am the soul of discretion.	M
It's what you are that's being denied and denied and denied in this kind of life.	N
There never was, and there never will be, another like you.	M
What kind of mother can't stand her own son?	M
We'll tear your soul apart!	M
So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me.	N
That how you gonna stand?	N
When I was in China on the All-American Ping Pong team, I just loved playing ping-pong with my Flexolite ping pong paddle.	M

Even entertaining the possibility of this for a minute has been exciting.	N
We ain't gonna bring Nike to their knees with some regional camel ad --	N
Well, to tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.	M
A person's body is his temple.	M
You are a savage creature John Spartan, and I wish for you to leave my domicile now!	M
Everybody take your seatsl Col.Landa, Lt.Aldo, and Bridget are still together.	N
What is the point of living in L.A. if you're not in the movie business?	M

It's the charming street urchin's face.	N
Now all we need... is skin.	M
