Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...	N
What's this all about, Tyler?	N
Go on and read it, John, and then start socking!	N
All I know is... you're beautiful.	M
If there's anything around here more important than my ego, I want it caught and shot now!	M
Hang on tightly, let go lightly.	M
What virus are we talking about, Dad?	N
Die screaming motherfucker.	M
I'll have to re-energize.	N
Can I go forward when my heart is here?	N
Lucius Hunt you answer me this moment!	N
The first and most important rule of gun-running is: Never get shot with your own merchandise.	M
And I'd gladly stand up; next to you and defend her still today.	N
Mmm, I'm a little bit lonely these days	M
L.A.P.D., I mean San Angeles P.D.	N
She did it because she got off on it, she did it for fun.	N
The two hours after school and before The Rockford Files, three days in a row.	N
See this is why we're not watching TV, people become obsessed.	M
Why'd you have to get us into this, Foxy?	N
Would it help if I explained to them I'm not homosexual?	N
Why don't you just shove a leash up my ass?	M
Well, kiddo, I thought you outgrew superstition.	M
I have a special surprise for you, Mommy!	M
Sammy, opening for David Brenner is a fine gig.	N
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.	N
Knowing what you've got, knowing what you need, knowing what you can do without - That's inventory control.	M
Captain, shall we raise our shields?	N
What is your malfunction, you fat barrel of monkey spunk?	M
Mrs. Peel, you're needed.	M
Goddamn, these people are confusing.	M
But I knew if anyone could straighten them out, you could.	N
Cause I don't forgive you, I don't forgive you for dying.	N
Joe College strikes out.	M
I just wish I understood what they were telling me.	N
I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.	N
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.	N
Prove what the big shots say is true -- we're street rats with no brains and no respect for nothin' -- includin' ourselves!	N
We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.	N
Nobody appreciates that kind of integrity anymore... the grain, the gritty look you get.	N
Hey, fuck him, let's eat this thing.	N
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is?	N
I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.	N
... and then, you know, you grow up.	N
You used to ride with that guy?	M
Man, they got a shit load of cookies!	M
Don't be a fool!	N
Sometimes it's a hard world for small things.	M
You, madam, are addressing a man, who is in fact quiet... and yet, not quiet, if I may offer to you a riddle.	M
Does my inner child need a spanking?	M
Once or twice more and we're going to be dead in space.	N
Also, we haven't had a chance to speak since THAT week.	N
and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.	N
Well, I don't think that store dick is gonna want this.	N
I guess I'm just no good?	N
Trying to get something real by telling yourself stories is a trap.	M
He was conceived during one of our rituals.	M
Made the semi-finals, didn't you?	N
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left.	N
This is the coolest thing I have ever seen.	M
Thanks for giving me this part, Mr. Cunningham.	N
I promise, that one day, everything's going to be better for you.	M
You can't argue about taste.	M
Billy, take the radio, leave the rest.	N
You'd be surprised about what you can get, if you ask for it the right way.	M
Miss Winston, EVERYBODY has a secret face!	M
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu.	N
I don't think I'll ever dry out.	M
Well, if it was a toothbrush I wouldn't ask questions, I'd just quote a price, but then a toothbrush is a non-lethal object, isn't it?	M
Come with me if you want to live!	M
We get to go home at 7:55.	N
I don't care so long as he's not a freak.	N
I don't think this is the lightning you're looking for.	M
Damn it, you're on a need-to-know basis, and you don't need to know.	M
I just love the feel of tuck and roll upholstery.	N
We've been after this cocksucker for a long time, and tonight we're gonna get him.	N
Oh, you amuse me, Roy, but I'm the only woman in America born after World War II that thinks astrology's a crock of shit.	M
It woulda been more humane to stake me down and leave me to the crows.	N
Oh, look, look, there's that ... that's -that's my old house.	N
This is pricks ficks.	N
I wish there was some way I could just pay the fine and go home.	M
It's going to be a long spring.	M
Look at this: an entire generation of Cinderellas and there's no glass slipper.	M
I sawed the main beam in half.	N
Oh, man, this isn't happening, it only thinks its happening.	M
There are some mistakes you cannot risk when you have children.	M
Just going to the kitchen to get some food, then I'm going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins.	M
Mal shoots him in the head, turns back.	N
Only second chance I know, is the chance to make the same mistake twice.	M
The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see?	N
What do I have to do to prove to you that I'm not a killer?	M
where's the happy little tire swing?	M
Tell me... do you like music, Mr. Finch?	M
Come on, Louise, don't blow it.	M
Here she stopped and, closing her eyes, took a deep breath of the flower-scented air of the broad expanse around her.	N
Guess old Melissa found what she was looking for.	M
His name is the Count De Rochefort.	N
I'm sure it won't be that hard.	N
You weren't getting out of buying those beers that easy.	N
This kind of murder...	N
We've got to get bail.	N
Shut up and fly straight!	M
This doesn't make any sense.	M
And what do you think you're going to do?	N
Your partner told me he was under the weather.	N
You know your head ain't on straight?	M
Come on up and watch TV.	M
She ransacked her own room, and I fell for it!	M
Oh, I think we're going to have several.	N
May the forks be with us.	M
She's a good woman, Louise.	N
I'm supposed to install a firewall on his system-	N
His will to live is very strong.	M
A person doesn't change just because you find out more.	M
Don't come back, either.	N
You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.	N
Three weeks ago, all I thought about was... well I didn't actually think about anything.	M
That's the nice thing about them.	N
And if someone like me doesn't write it, where they gonna get it?	N
Well, you didn't think I forgot about you, did you?	M
Shit on my dick, or blood on my knife?	M
No -- don't you see -- crawling --	N
You drop this bombshell on me.	N
I'm not working for any other paper!	N
A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.	N
I'm ready to shoot RIGHT NOW.	M
Bring in that floating fat man, the Baron!	M
You just stay in the car and watch and be ready.	N
He should join the Marines, they could make something out of him.	N
I'm surprised you're available.	N
What are you gunna do about it up in your fucking high window with your goddamn binoculars?	M
You're in the middle of a police station.	N
Mr. President, I have come to speak on behalf of the accused.	N
How are we going to explain to Brick Top that his fight isn't going to .	N
What're you talking about?	N
Inside the packet you'll find a clearly worked out severance package.	N
So what's this money deal you were talking about?	N
I've never credited the Alliance with an overabundance of brains and if you're the best they've got...	M
It's not contaminated, you don't even know what that word means.	M
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?	N
Well, I think we should just make our delivery as soon as possible, don't you?	N
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.	N
Nothing is permanent, not even death.	M
I'm not sure I agree with you a hundred percent on your police work, there, Lou.	M
How terrible is wisdom, when it brings no profit to the wise.	M
I am a leaf on the wind - watch how I soar.	M
It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-	N
In the future, when a woman is crying like that, she isn't having any fun.	M
See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.	N
I'd like to kill the freaking guy who broke this mirror.	M
You never know, lightning could strike.	M
If you could change something in your life, anything at all, what would it be?	M
Sleep is for the weak Mr. President.	M
Tell me your last name.	N
Kids - 10 seconds of joy, 30 years of misery.	M
The first step is love, the second is mercy.	M
What if Bo's baby monitor is picking up signals from the extraterrestrials?	N
Just tell me what's really going on.	N
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.	M
A toast to my big brother George: The richest man in town.	M
I've always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.	M
Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!	N
You must know which one it is, you sat there for over a year.	N
Anna Crowe, I am in love... in love I am.	M
No, no, Marvin, it's fine really.	N
But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you.	N
You gave it to those Wall Street bastards?	M
You were the only audience I ever needed.	M
Sicker 'n' a dog, that's for sure.	M
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-	N
Thus with a kiss I die.	M
Maybe he'll adopt me.	M
Why can't you all just die and leave me alone?	M
I'd rather fight with you than make love with anyone else.	M
Tell her what happened - Everything.	N
I guess I never looked at it like that before.	N
Aren't we saying cocaine is more potent than our Constitution?	N
Of course, in Alabama the Tuscaloosa, but that's entirely irrelephant.	N
I shall not be caged like some animal	N
I play a lot of XBOX.	M
And strip everything you don't need out of the planes.	N
Did you ever try to run in high heels?	N
Can you try and reach into my left jacket pocket?	N
That's right, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake!	N
I want to know everyone you've met for the last twenty years.	N
I don't, I didn't -- I met this girl earlier, Minnie Tyco?	N
Between take-off and landing, we have our time together, but that's all we get.	N
You know, you could have some really fun backyard get-togethers out here.	N
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.	M
Have I been sleeping later?	N
You don't have to tell me your secret if you don't want to.	N
Why don't y'all go back to your *own* cabin, if you want to play with C.W.	M
Mr. Jacks nods, heads for home.	N
Kirill, we don't kill little babies.	M
Where did you pick up that cheap trick?	M
I'd like to think that the last thing that went through his head, other than that bullet, was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.	M
It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy.	N
Chicks cannot hold their smoke, dat's what it is.	M
It's a business lie, it's different from a life lie.	M
Life is just a dream on the way to death.	M
I already got everything I need from you.	N
Night time is the right time.	M
He's got to... All these years, runnin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him... Now we caught up...	N
No, but the boat has to be here somewhere!	N
Let's be able to say we were the ones who put peer pressure out to pasture.	N
Look at him... That's my brother god damnit.	M
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"?	M
He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.	N
Don't you just love New York in the fall?	M
My husband's dead, isn't he?	N
The broads're probably lining up right now, waiting for ol' Ty and his buddy Stump.	N
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and so inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?	M
Hasta la vista, baby.	M
Look Ah this isn't really necessary.	N
And then, Black Beauty couldn't take it any longer and he finally did some of his own mounting.	M
If anyone needs me, I'll be in the Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen.	M
I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but..	N
The Indian used campfires.	N
We'll divide into teams.	N
We have had security problems and to cut a long story short, I need another seven million Euros lost in the books.	N
Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack.	M
Sixty thou a year, domestic.	N
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!	N
The fool thought he had duplicated the moment of creation.	N
I'm not running -- not from you.	N
If this is all a dream, why can't there be more girls?	M
I think I just came... didn't you feel it?	M
You're the one who's in a hurry, aren't you?	N
Tell him I couldn't read his lips.	N
I'm paying people just to wait for you.	N
I didn't come this far to be breakfast.	M
This maniac should be wearing a number, not a badge.	M
Yeah, so did you, Bernstein.	N
Go ahead... take your best shot, motherfucker!	M
The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --	N
All right buddy, that's it...	N
Bring in the logic probe!	M
I am Jack's smirking revenge.	M
Then I suggest you go home and do the same.	N
That's the last time I leave you in charge.	M
Yes, things are going quite well.	N
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago.	N
Today I saw a slave become more powerful than the Emperor of Rome.	M
We're not gonna have a war, we're gonna have the appearance of a war.	M
You know how women lie.	M
Lately, your low self-esteem is just good common sense.	M
Don't make a sound unless I say.	N
Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you.	N
We got a dollar ninety-eight, and you're laughing!	M
Why did I kill all the others?	N
You are in a position unsuitable to give orders.	M
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?	N
Excuse me, but what are you talking about?	N
We're just good patriotic Americans like yourself.	N
We'll be comin' for you tonight, sister.	N
That's my new favorite camel.	M
Is the colonel's underwear a matter of national security?	M
It's a wooden pickle.	M
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.	M
"The multiplying villainies of nature do swarm upon him  disdaining fortune/with his brandish'd steel, which smoked with bloody execution...?	M
That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.	N
All you need is love, John Lennon, smart man, shot in the back very sad.	M
Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.	M
Sure don't look none too prosperous.	M
<u>All</u> restaurants are now Taco Bell.	N
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.	N
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?	M
Mark, this isn't some kind of jo...	N
Monsieur LaPadite, to both your family and your cows I say: Bravo.	M
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.	N
Oh, God, I'm so ashamed!	M
Like I care about your shit.	N
Hey, Cherita... want a cigarette?	N
They went with someone who had more theme-park experience.	M
I took the bread.	N
Repeat drunk drivers, and I'm gonna get 'em all off.	N
But his father was a gambler.	N
My boy's wicked smart.	M
First time, shame on you.	N
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics.	M
I have therefore classified him a hostage of the war criminal known as Nero.	N
No matter what happened to you.	N
Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac.	M
But, if you decide to have the baby, then, at that very instant, when you're absolutely sure... tell him.	N
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours.	N
Oh, Nicky, I love you because you know such lovely people.	M
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels!	M
General, count me in.	M
These are fossilized bone fragments I've been able to study, gathered from the bomb site in Dallas...	N
Mom, this is so not the time to be yourself.	M
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.	N
Maybe I left my sense of humor in my other suit.	M
I have worked out a little more of our plan.	N
He is the kindest and best of men.	M
Your dad has gone too far, Kirill.	N
Just because you've got me safe in this little trap, you think you can bully me into feeling whatever you want me to feel!	M
I swear I will not kill anyone.	M
Tell me how old you are, Eddie.	N
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.	N
I was 27 years old the first time I died.	M
These men may be the only defense you've got.	N
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.	N
Reject the basic assumptions of civilization, especially the importance of material possessions.	M
I've been monitoring their interaction.	N
Some people are just born with tragedy in their blood.	M
Who would waste time killing you... besides me?	N
We didn't even know she had been taken hostage.	N
I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.	M
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.	M
It won't affect me, I'm already a woman.	M
The east side is always faster.	N
I'm not dying in a fucking rat maze!	M
Don't make me take off my sunglasses!	M
We mortals have many weaknesses; we feel too much, hurt too much or too soon we die, but we do have the chance of love.	M
Quaffable, but uh... far from transcendent.	M
And so she walked out of our lives forever.	M
Not in the mood, I guess.	N
I got all this information illegally.	N
Andy Dufresne - who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side.	M
Drink with your brains, that's our motto.	M
It's not the sort of responsibility the founding fathers might have recognized.	N
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!	N
And I think I stole that from the back of an in-flight magazine.	N
Come on, suck your finger, you'll be seeing mermaids everywhere!	N
I like to understand what I'm shown.	M
It's Halloween, everyone's entitled to one good scare.	M
The guy was a total fruitcake.	N
Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red light!	N
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals.	M
The perfect nuclear family.	N
We can't let those gang-bangers get away, man...	N
Next time, remind me to do this outside.	M
Sorry we were gone so long, but we had to pick up Hank!	M
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothin'.	M
To get to the other side, and 1 point 772453851.	N
Alright, stand back you pedestrians, this ain't no automobile accident.	M
It's like War of the Worlds.	M
Extra Cheese is two dollars.	M
Well, I am the last person to persuade you, but don't do it blindly... if this is your decision, you must be prepared to face the consequences...	N
This guy's a restraining order waiting to happen.	M
She's tapping Kara, and Kara knows you know me.	N
I'm gonna give you an L.A.P.D ass-whuppin'!	M
Why do they always run?	M
That's a lot of fish.	M
How would I know, I mean he lies about everything anyway!	N
I can't wait to see afternoon.	N
I don't think that there's anything worse than being ordinary.	M
Oh, God, get me out.	N
Behold, as a wild ass in the desert, go I forth to my work.	M
She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!	N
Schmucks are people too.	M
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead.	N
I think someone better call the police.	M
Activate your weirding modules...	N
It's time we were away.	N
These are the first-born sons of Gotham City!	N
Bet the last place you ever go.	N
This is simply a reflection of my appreciation.	N
I can't run with you, Mickey!	N
We have to go in here!	N
Just open it up, let the woman out.	N
I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.	N
Welcome to the real world.	M
You makin' a nigga fall hard, man...	M
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.	N
I was trying to keep you out of this.	N
Some weird fuckin' shit, eh, Bud?	M
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.	N
No, don't do that, I had a big lunch.	N
You ever feel as if your mind had started to erode?	M
Never fear, Smith is here.	M
Depends on the woman I marry.	N
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.	N
I was responsible... in some way...	N
If you piss in your pants, you only stay warm for so long.	M
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.	M
My curiosity is killing me; what are you so rambunctious about tonight?	N
A toast, to the end of the world.	M
Let's put the women and children to bed and go lookin' for dinner!	M
Logan... you renewed!	M
You didn't straighten the place up, did you?	N
OK, so we got a trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, these folks drive by, there's a high-speed pursuit, ends here and then this execution-type deal.	M
The Emperor's made a critical error, and the time for our attack has come.	M
Let it shine, shine, shine, All around the world!!	N
You think I did good?	N
She's a little pissed off right now but...	N
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills Guy.	M
Frank Wheeler, I think you're the most interesting person I've ever met.	M
Do not know how many more are in the vicinity but I am taking steps for another visitation.	N
I avoided capture by using your Mak'tar stealth haze.	M
hibb... hibbdy... Maybe I did die in the explosion, you know.	M
I told you, if you ever touch me again, I'll kill you.	M
I think it was a simple case of wanting to be a man again after all that abortion business.	N
Not interrupting anything, I hope.	N
There is no place for excuses when you are the LEADER!	M
I think we'd better run...	N
Now all you gotta do is pull the trigger mister.	M
You make every day feel like kindergarten.	M
After fighting, everything else in your life got the volume turned down.	M
Well I don't know I mean that's pretty severe.	N
...And this man on the hill comes.	N
We have to make it down to the bottom.	N
Thank you for talking about me behind my back - that'll be useful in court.	M
I got her back for you.	N
We are grateful for the time we have been given.	M
I'll torture you so slowly, you'll think it's a career.	M
You shouldn't be callin' people lousy little shrimps, Oscar, unless you're referrin' to the family resemblance in your brother here.	M
He's almost a stranger, and I prefer him to you!	M
Maybe I'll just sit here and bleed at you.	M
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?	N
What family he had tended to... not survive.	N
John Connor... We gotta find this guy.	M
Forgive me, I'm blowing your mind.	M
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.	N
And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.	N
Hey, what's wrong with Meat Loaf's butt?	M
We have to shut them down...	N
...aced those guys that tried to kill us!	N
Maybe we're at war with Norway?	M
Tomo-chan told me to.	M
I am the soul of discretion.	M
It's what you are that's being denied and denied and denied in this kind of life.	N
So, you know where I am...and now I know where you are, Anna Ivanovna.	M
What kind of mother can't stand her own son?	M
We'll tear your soul apart!	M
With you as her mother her father could be anybody in Actors' Equity!	N
You stomp around like a forties drunk and you're a lousy shot.	N
So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me.	N
That how you gonna stand?	N
Even entertaining the possibility of this for a minute has been exciting.	N
We ain't gonna bring Nike to their knees with some regional camel ad --	N
Stick 'em in the bushes for now.	N
A person's body is his temple.	M
You are a savage creature John Spartan, and I wish for you to leave my domicile now!	M
My playpen used to be in her studio.	N
It's like throwing gasoline on a flame.	M
Life was sweet... For a minute.	M
Well, I think we should start searching for your son.	N
It's not you I don't trust.	N
I can't get much wetter.	N
We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.	N
You are hanging on by a very thin thread and I dig that about you!	M
All I ever wanted was a single thing worth fighting for.	M
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.	M
Well, let's not drag the constitution into this.	M
Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?	N
Fight on, fight on, dear old Muncie/Fight on, hoist the gold and blue/You'll be tattered, torn, and hurtin'/Once the Munce is done with you/Go... Eagles!	M
I could, like, kill a guy with these things.	M
We know all that we need to know --	N
Yeah, turn it up!	N
An honest man is always in trouble, remember that Simon.	M
OK, last one to kill a bad guy buys the beer.	M
You throw money around like it was money.	M
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.	N
It's the charming street urchin's face.	N
Now all we need... is skin.	M
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.	M
So help me I mean it!	N
What's wrong with being a large mammal?	M
No fire, I beg you.	N
I just cannot believe any of this voodoo bullshit!	M
You gotta dollar -- You're a friend of mine!	N
Mission control to Chuck, come in...	N
That sex was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.	M
Don't give me any of that intelligent life crap, just give me something I can blow up	M
What does he know about man alone?	M
I haven't been nice to you.	N
All you need is love.	M
Why don't you take my oil and I'll fucking pay you?	N
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.	N
Just start with your name.	N
This is Chicago as it exists today.	N
To avenge my father, I will turn you into killing machines.	N
I'll probably shit blood tonight.	M
