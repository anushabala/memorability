You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -	N
You were chillin', kind of creepy even.	N
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice, right now.	M
I just don't think "nice" is a particularly interesting thing to be.	N
It could have been - whole world - Willie Stark.	M
You know, Judge, dirt's a funny thing.	N
You throw money around like it was money.	M
He swept the old gang out of office.	N
Well, kiddo, I thought you outgrew superstition.	M
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles.	N
It's Halloween, everyone's entitled to one good scare.	M
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is?	N
I think I just came... didn't you feel it?	M
Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.	N
You are a wuss: part wimp, and part pussy.	M
You start from the second you walk into biology.	N
Hope you had a hell of a piss, Arnold!	M
Well, that's not the way it works, really.	N
This is U.S. History, I see the globe right there.	M
You gotta dollar -- You're a friend of mine!	N
I'm not killing people... my future's in television.	M
So what's this money deal you were talking about?	N
Life was sweet... For a minute.	M
Head of network sales at thirty.	N
What kind of a man are you?	M
Yeah, well, you already know the story.	N
Sooner or later everyone needs a haircut.	M
Every dog has his day.	M
Yeah, so did you, Bernstein.	N
Thank you, for summing that up	M

Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims in its...	N
You are... a beautiful, beautiful, butterfly.	M
I've been monitoring their interaction.	N
She is severely fuckable, ain't she?	M
Do you think she woke up one morning and said: I think I'll go to law school today.	M
We're defending Brooke Windham, whose very wealthy husband was found shot to death in their Beacon Hill mansion.	N
Joey, have you ever been in a... in a Turkish prison?	M
I'm a civilian, not a trout - you have no authority over me whatsoever.	M
And even if you were on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.	N
We, uh, trapped him with our chopper.	M
You can fight a lot of enemies and survive, but not your biology.	M
Why don't you take my oil and I'll fucking pay you?	N
The first and most important rule of gun-running is: Never get shot with your own merchandise.	M
At least when they say they're going to have a war, they keep their word.	N
The second rule of gun-running is always ensure you have a foolproof way of getting paid.	M
They are consuming small arms and ammunition and the cash register is well and truly ringing.	N
Yo wastoid, you're not gonna blaze up in here.	M
How would I know, I mean he lies about everything anyway!	N
Chicks cannot hold their smoke, dat's what it is.	M
Screws fall out all the time, the world is an imperfect place.	M
That man... is a brownie hound.	M
Oh, obscene finger gestures from such a pristine girl.	M
You know what I got for Christmas this year?	N
Because I can get into this vault in half an hour.	N
Come on up and watch TV.	M
That's what I am told.	N
But I tell you what, Suit.	N
Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac.	M
I got her back for you.	N
I asked my girlfriend to marry me and she asked me to move out.	M
If you're around you should drop by and check out the new apartment.	N
I guess you're not home.	M
You got me pretty fucking curious.	N
He went out the window... why would someone do that?	M
You stayed there five times in the past six months.	N
I'm gonna break your face!	M
Why don't you wait until morning.	N
We can't bury Shelly - S-She's a friend of ours.	M
What the hell are you doing down here, jerkin' off?	N
Do you think he'll ever kiss me again?	M
Great, because I haven't quite bankrupted us yet.	N
Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!	N
All he wanted was some Mushu.	M
I can get to Ricky Tan.	N
I'm gonna give you an L.A.P.D ass-whuppin'!	M
No, don't do that, I had a big lunch.	N
I think someone better call the police.	M
Don't worry, the plates are safe.	N
The appearance of law must be upheld, especially when it's being broken.	M
It's not the sort of responsibility the founding fathers might have recognized.	N
I come for my due and proper.	M
It's the young Vallon, is it?	N
Is the colonel's underwear a matter of national security?	M
Oh, spare me the psychobabble father bullshit.	M
We'll work out of my apartment.	N
So this is what a courtroom looks like.	M
Their fate was sealed the moment Santiago died.	N
Maybe, if we work at it, we can get Dawson charged with the Kennedy assassination.	M
Thank you for playing "Should We or Should-We-Not Follow the Advice of the Galacticly Stupid".	N
Whatever happened to saluting an officer when he leaves the room?	M
We do not negotiate with terrorists!	M
Can I offer you a drink?	N
In a world where the dead are returning to life, the word "trouble" loses much of its meaning.	M
I could send five hundred men against that thing and they'd all come back in body bags.	N
What happened, Riley, did you get fucked?	M
I don't usually need that many.	M
Gotta go get the keys, Riley.	N
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.	N
I don't know WHAT he was, but he made Frankenstein look like a lily!	M
Now, look, I want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.	N
The Vietnam War was fought over a bet that Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onassis.	M
Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.	N
This guy's a restraining order waiting to happen.	M
That I won't be back for two weeks.	N
I am an American citizen, and I demand to see Alice Sutton.	M
If you could remember who stabbed you with the wheelchair, and where it happened it would really help.	M
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.	N
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe... it's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.	M
Like running into a liquor store with a .357 magnum in your hand, feeling the adrenalin pumping through your veins.	N
What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?	N
So there's no information on the street, which is how cases get made.	N
Paranoia is just reality on a finer scale.	M
I already got everything I need from you.	N
Look... everyone needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometimes, it's what we are.	M
Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.	N
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she is giving head.	M
I'll be up in a while to help you ring in the New Year.	N
Oooh... a little B&E action.	M
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.	N
I was trying to keep you out of this.	N
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals.	M
So, if you'll do me a favor and let me the fuck out of here...	N
I don't fucking know how to pray.	M
I just... we're running a little late.	N
Mrs. Robinson, if you don't mind my saying so, this conversation is getting a little strange.	M
Excuse me - I think I'd just like to check something on the car for a minute -	N
Do you need any gas, Father?	M
Six blocks up - three blocks over.	N
Welcome to the desert of the real.	M
This is Chicago as it exists today.	N
Can you hear me, Morpheus?	N
Welcome to the real world.	M
You know what real is?	N
Nothing that a bottle of Jack and a straight razor won't fix.	M
And I think I stole that from the back of an in-flight magazine.	N
Mom, this is so not the time to be yourself.	M
Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!	N
I hear that make-up sex is the best kind.	N
Oh sweet Jesus, who gave that woman an amp?	M
She must have drowned her rules in the Chardonnay.	N
I'd rather fight with you than make love with anyone else.	M
Let me teach you a trick: if you look people in the eye, they won't notice what you're wearing.	M
And then, I was going to get out of here and leave you alone, but halfway to the station, I realized--	N
Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.	N
You speak so many bloody languages, and you never want to talk.	M
There is no God, but I hope someone watches over you.	M
You know - the hollow - here - does that have an official name?	N
If you live another day I will be very impressed.	M
Look, you gave me some work over the last year.	N
You are in a position unsuitable to give orders.	M
But I don't believe you would kill yourself!	N
Too much to drink, Dr. Jones?	M
No -- don't you see -- crawling --	N
I don't, I didn't -- I met this girl earlier, Minnie Tyco?	N
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.	N
Oh, come on this is crazy; maybe she doesn't want to be found.	M
You find out what you wanted to know, mister?	N
He won't let them go!	M
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.	M
You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.	N
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.	M
Wow, I guess you can light a fart on fire, huh?	M
My money is just as good as any white person's!	N
Shut of ze power Cartman, zis is very important Cartman.	M
You're all a bunch of stupid sons a bitches!	N
Ya like that, don't ya, bitch?	M
Well what are you waiting for pal?!	N
All combat takes place at night, in the rain, and at the junction of four map segments.	M
I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk Driver.	N
We're not gonna have a war, we're gonna have the appearance of a war.	M
I just bet my balls and shook on it.	M
I'm going to see what the hell happened.	N
A strange wang right in my palm.	M
I've seen another man's diddly.	N
To girls with big tits!	M
Where's the women, man?	N
I just cannot believe any of this voodoo bullshit!	M
Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?	N
Anybody touches me, and we go!	M
So help me I mean it!	N
Maybe we're at war with Norway?	M
Bet the last place you ever go.	N
It's not contaminated, you don't even know what that word means.	M
What if Bo's baby monitor is picking up signals from the extraterrestrials?	N
It's like War of the Worlds.	M
I'm sorry, what book is this?	N
See this is why we're not watching TV, people become obsessed.	M
Even entertaining the possibility of this for a minute has been exciting.	N
Have you checked the children?	M
I'll torture you so slowly, you'll think it's a career.	M
Is looking like a constipated warthog a prerequisite for getting a job in the art world?	M
I'm not happy about having to steal that horse, but I do have my pride.	N
Did anything about that seem unusual to you?	M
Gives her time to get the wrong impression.	N
Unlimited technology from the whole universe, and we cruise 'round in a Ford P.O.S.	M
We'll take it from here.	M
Maybe you won't have to.	N
I told you, if you ever touch me again, I'll kill you.	M
You're gonna go in the Denny's restaurant and stay there.	N
You know, Phillip, you have a goddamned red, white and blue American right to eat cotton candy and ride roller coasters.	M
I need me a time machine with a loud radio to take me where I'm going.	M
'Dear Robert, I just wanted to tell you that me leaving has nothing to do with you.	N
Sure don't look none too prosperous.	M
Don't matter what kin' either.	N
Takes no nerve to do something, ain't nothin' else you can do.	M
Uncle John don't talk much but when he does he shore talks sense.	N
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"?	M
That's right, Stud, hold me down.	N
Hell will hold no surprises for us.	M
You killed my father, your ass is mine!	M
I'm fireproof, you're not.	M
Tell Father I'll be home.	N
Then you are like us; your home is here.	M
It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.	N
The war will still be here tomorrow.	M
What will you do after the war?	N
Also, we're heading right for the sun and can't seem to change course.	N
And then, Black Beauty couldn't take it any longer and he finally did some of his own mounting.	M
No, it's these... fucking queers on blades that can't accept a fucking pass to save their lives!	N
Since you like chicks, right, do you just look at yourself naked in the mirror all the time?	M
She does this big ol' pelvic thrust - cracks my tooth in half, sends it down my throat.	N
Archie is *not* fucking Mr. Weatherbee!	M
Like I care about your shit.	N
I feel a hate crime coming on.	M
We're gonna take off soon...	N
I think it's more like Banky's having a real problem with all things not hetero right about now.	M
Kind of gal Alyssa is, you don't think she's been in the middle of an all - girl group-grope?	N
Oh, you had a moment!	N
Let's put the women and children to bed and go lookin' for dinner!	M
My dad, brothers, uncles -- we all drink and sooner or later we all fuck up.	N
Godfather has more eyes than a pineapple!	M
We must stand by him as one.	N
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.	M
Can I go forward when my heart is here?	N
You kiss by the book.	M
I will bite my thumb at them, which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.	M
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maiden heads, take it in what sense thou wilt.	N
Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man.	M
I've come for you, Margaret.	M
Do you want to be dead Albert?	M
Who do you think you're fuckin' with?	M
Why should I give house- room to your sort?	N
Take your clothes off.	M
You couldn't run an egg and spoon race Eric.	M
I thought you were dead, asshole.	M
But, Dr. Hudgens, I was just...	N
This doesn't make any sense.	M
I think we'd better run...	N
If it bleeds, we can kill it.	M
Billy, take the radio, leave the rest.	N
She says the jungle... it just came alive and took him.	M
I should've wasted the bitch when I had the chance.	N
That's a real nasty habit you got there.	M
Is he always this funny, or only on days when he's wanted for murder?	M
I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.	N
The Red Soxs are always winning, until they lose.	M
The first step is love, the second is mercy.	M
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients.	N
I make her wait and it drives her crazy.	N
I'd always had nightmares, but now the ghosts didn't wait for me to sleep.	M
Don't make me take off my sunglasses!	M
Your friend there just untied the water beggar.	N
I'd rather die than to stay away from you.	M
To get to the other side, and 1 point 772453851.	N
Maybe he'll adopt me.	M
We left you a message.	N
Wow, that is one ugly dude.	M
Viggy, Viggy, Viggy, you have been a bad monkey!	M
I'll keep to the middle of the channel.	N
Let's see what happens when we take away the puppy.	M
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.	N
The needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.	M
I know this will come as a pleasant surprise for you...	N
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and have a heart attack.	M
We're on our feet now, and now we're gonna talk out to the car.	N
My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.	M
Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here: you're Brett, right?	N
If my answers frighten you then you should cease asking scary questions.	M
Hey, you won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of me personality, will you madam?	M
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.	N
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.	N
Ever seen one of these before?	N
I now declare this bridge open!	M
Nice building... bad roof... goooood parking.	M
I'm going down to relax.	N
What's the good of being a ghost if you can't frighten people away.	M
Go ahead... make my millenium.	M
This burg got a cathouse?	N
You don't have an appointment, do you?	N
I'm not an enigma, just a contradiction.	M
Hang on tightly, let go lightly.	M
But his father was a gambler.	N
Welcome back Jack, to the house of addiction.	M
Jack knew it still wasn't quite right...	N
I understand if you don't, but I hope that you do.	M
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.	N
Without hope there's no point to anything.	M
He doesn't give a shit about anyone.	N
I love you, but I should have never married you.	M
Why'd you have to get us into this, Foxy?	N
He didn't take the money.	M
it's what I always wanted!	N
To the top of Mount Wanna-hock-a-loogie.	M
Just start with your name.	N
You think you can do these things, but you just can't, Nemo.	M
Just stop trying to speak whale, you're gonna make things worse.	N
All drains lead to the ocean.	M
Okay, you gotta be quick.	N
I didn't come this far to be breakfast.	M
No, but the boat has to be here somewhere!	N
My oath of celibacy is on record, Captain.	M
or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?	N
We all create God in our own image.	M
All ship's functions going to automatic, Captain.	N
The fool thought he had duplicated the moment of creation.	N
Religion is flawed because man is flawed.	M
It's said he was a doctor.	N
There are some mistakes you cannot risk when you have children.	M
You know, I always think about when you...Oh, there's no point.	N
Lately, your low self-esteem is just good common sense.	M
Hell, I don't mind driving her at night.	N
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and so inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?	M
We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.	N
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower!	M
We have monitored a large explosion in your sector.	N
There is an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.	M
Why, that cunning little Vulcan!	M
Now there's a poser.	N
What do you think YOU'VE been doing?	N
Guess who's coming to dinner.	M
Captain, shall we raise our shields?	N
Nobody tells me how to run my property.	N
My husband tells me you're in sharks.	M
Excuse me, but what are you talking about?	N
I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.	M
After this is over, they'll make me into a Goddamned hero.	N
Sucking the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone.	M
If I don't ask him, at least I won't be disobeying him.	M
The meetings will be conducted by myself and the other new initiates now present.	N
You're not someone I could get interested in, Craig, you play with dolls.	M
Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.	M
I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.	N
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man.	M
What happens when a man goes through his own portal?	M
I moved his arm across your girlfriend's glorious tit.	N
Truth is for suckers, Johnny Boy.	M
This is my type of chick.	N
Shoulda, woulda, coulda, pal.	M
Wish I could, Gordy.	N
Now move, honky, before I cut your white ass.	M
I hope, for your sake, that you were initiating a mating ritual.	M
Least I could do for the captain of the enterprise.	M
and every time it scared the hell out of me.	N
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.	M
Only one is a wanderer; two together are always going somewhere.	M
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?	N
One final thing I have to do... and then I'll be free of the past.	M
If your husband is awake, say you couldn't sleep and went out for some air.	N
There's an old saying: Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer.	M
Well, you didn't think I forgot about you, did you?	M
One, I was on to you the moment they turned you.	N
Come D'Artagnan, we're saving the King!	M
His name is the Count De Rochefort.	N
However, if you would like to entertain me with a story, I'm eager to hear it.	N
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life?	N
Just remember that when you sign for the tip.	M
I'll pull into the parking garage and wait.	N
C'mon baby, come ta' papa, I'll kiss ya' fuckin' dalmatian.	M
Tell me you heard the shot and you're calling the police right now...	N
No one kills him but me!	M
Welcome to the party, pal.	M
Bad for your health anyway.	N
Nine million terrorists in the world and I gotta kill one with feet smaller than my sister.	M
After I get my foot out of my mouth, we'll really be cooking, and then I can --	N
Nothing is permanent, not even death.	M
You picked the wrong day not to use the ATM.	M
We don't want another Pearl Street Bridge, do we?	N
The number one fear of people isn't dying, it's public speaking.	M
I want to know everyone you've met for the last twenty years.	N
So if that dope doesn't arrive, for whatever reason - Cousin or no cousin - don't let me down.	N
I haven't talked to them in years.	N
The most important thing in business is honesty, integrity, hardwork... family... never forgetting where we came from.	M
Though I'd rather not have to drag my ass all the way up here every time.	N
I started playing baseball when I was a kid like everybody else but better than everybody else.	M
The broads're probably lining up right now, waiting for ol' Ty and his buddy Stump.	N
Know ye that a prince and a great man has fallen this day.	M
Or... there's the kind with one great subject that consumes them forever.	N
I'm not sure I agree with you a hundred percent on your police work, there, Lou.	M
Now, I saw some rough stuff on your priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide...	N
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.	N
OK, so we got a trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, these folks drive by, there's a high-speed pursuit, ends here and then this execution-type deal.	M
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?	N
You know, there's only one problem with you: you're perfect.	M
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?	N
The White House is the single greatest home court advantage in the modern world.	M
Sydney, seldom does a day go by that I'm not burned in effigy.	N
Sydney, I can't challenge the school bully to a fight just because he picked on my girlfriend.	N
If anyone needs me, I'll be in the Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen.	M
If my friend Andy Shepherd had shown up, I would have liked that campaign.	N
Sydney, Congress doesn't take this long.	M
You know, I'm a little nervous.	N
These girls want to party.	N
Quaffable, but uh... far from transcendent.	M
You drop this bombshell on me.	N
You don't understand my plight.	M
Took her forever to find them.	N
Behold, as a wild ass in the desert, go I forth to my work.	M
My name is a killing word.	M
Set the range for two meters.	N
You have no need for your weapons with me, Gurney Halleck.	M
To avenge my father, I will turn you into killing machines.	N
Alia keeps pace with the storm.	N
Activate your weirding modules...	N
Bring in that floating fat man, the Baron!	M
Who is this Paula Atreides to the Guild?	N
With a Fremen suit in good working order, one can sustain life for weeks, even in the deep desert.	N
A thousand commanders, and we get the Belgian from Alcoholics Anonymous!	M
Come on, suck your finger, you'll be seeing mermaids everywhere!	N
Now all you gotta do is pull the trigger mister.	M
"Jim," I says, "You are a liar and a horse thief.	N
Did Pa used to kill folks?	M
I think they got the fever.	N
You know how women lie.	M
What's all that wood?	N
I suppose you know, Bob, if I ever see you again I'm just going to start shooting and figure it was self-defense.	M
Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.	N
And in spite of me, a wonder was revealed.	N
I'm paying people just to wait for you.	N
That doesn't really work, does it?	M
It is already here in my head.	N
Is that woman still lying on the floor?	M
At last I shall be freed by death!	N
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat!	M
And how will you make him keep it?	N
A young man trying to impress beyond his abilities.	M
Taking out what you should never have put in.	N
Well, isn't this a good opportunity to... slip her one?	M
Bugger this for a bunch of bananas.	M
You think it's the wrong moment.	N
If I were to employ a wet rag would I have to pay it as much as I pay you?	M
Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.	N
Just going to the kitchen to get some food, then I'm going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins.	M
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.	N
I need to see you right away.	N
You are in the courtroom of world opinion and you can answer yes or no.	M
But today, again, if I heard you correctly, you now say they do not exist.	N
We were eyeball to eyeball and I think the other fella just blinked.	M
Mr. President, agreeing to such a trade would be tantamount to paying ransom.	N
I'll whistle up some luck for you.	M
We need to be positive before we react.	N
Sleep is for the weak Mr. President.	M
Feels good to win, doesn't it?	N
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.	M
And we need to get these guys out of the White House.	N
Well, gentlemen, if anybody's got any great ideas, now's the time.	M
How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup?	N
Does my inner child need a spanking?	M
There's a glitch in my swing.	N
Greatness courts failure.	M
Now wait, Doreen.	N
Oh, you amuse me, Roy, but I'm the only woman in America born after World War II that thinks astrology's a crock of shit.	M
Why do men always insist on measuring their dicks?	M
Not only do I look like Meirschultz, I am Meirschultz!	M
Well, you know, we hate to operate on these cases.	N
Once a ham, always a ham!	M
Perfect--we will have to work fast.	N
Years of Academy training wasted.	M
But -- the hat looked good.	N
I wanna ride the pony...	M
We are currently obtaining the...ignition sticks.	N
No-one has ever attempted a double bypass brain transplant before.	M
I've always wanted to put a spaceman into orbit.	N
I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school!	M
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.	N
I think you've had enough tea for today, let's get you outta here, Buzz.	M
Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.	N
In the morning we'll plan our fight.	N

Just pour the drink, you fairy fuck.	M
Hey fuck-ass, give me a beer.	M
You'll make it outta here.	N

Except, if you'll excuse me, I'm not in jail.	N
I like Harry, but I can't deny he sweats a little.	M
