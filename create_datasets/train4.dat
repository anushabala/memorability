Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...	N
What's this all about, Tyler?	N
Go on and read it, John, and then start socking!	N
I - I don't know, Bill.	N
All I know is... you're beautiful.	M
If there's anything around here more important than my ego, I want it caught and shot now!	M
What virus are we talking about, Dad?	N
It was our money and we want it back.	N
I'll have to re-energize.	N
Lucius Hunt you answer me this moment!	N
Au contraire baby, you can't resist me.	M
I don't think this is the lightning you're looking for.	M
I always thought I knew the punchline.	N
These men are the leaders of a terrorist organization wanted for the abduction of a monkey.	N
And I'd gladly stand up; next to you and defend her still today.	N
Mmm, I'm a little bit lonely these days	M
You'd make a good poker player, kid.	M
L.A.P.D., I mean San Angeles P.D.	N
She did it because she got off on it, she did it for fun.	N
The two hours after school and before The Rockford Files, three days in a row.	N
I mean, he was already in Vegas a couple of years and he had the fuckin' place clocked.	N
Would it help if I explained to them I'm not homosexual?	N
NOBODY'S GONNA PUT ME TO SLEEP!	N
I have a special surprise for you, Mommy!	M
Sammy, opening for David Brenner is a fine gig.	N
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?	N
Now, on top of everything else, I gotta make sure no one fucks around with the Golden Jew.	M
Knowing what you've got, knowing what you need, knowing what you can do without - That's inventory control.	M
What is your malfunction, you fat barrel of monkey spunk?	M
Mrs. Peel, you're needed.	M
Goddamn, these people are confusing.	M
But I knew if anyone could straighten them out, you could.	N
Don't worry Jennie.	N
Cause I don't forgive you, I don't forgive you for dying.	N
I just wish I understood what they were telling me.	N
We fell from grace together.	N
I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.	N
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.	N
Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up...	N
We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.	N
Nobody appreciates that kind of integrity anymore... the grain, the gritty look you get.	N
Hey, fuck him, let's eat this thing.	N
I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.	N
... and then, you know, you grow up.	N
You used to ride with that guy?	M
Man, they got a shit load of cookies!	M
I was making time with your girl.	N
They abide, and they endure.	M
Don't be a fool!	N
My eyes still hurt from reading that movie.	M
You, madam, are addressing a man, who is in fact quiet... and yet, not quiet, if I may offer to you a riddle.	M
I'd be monarch of all I survey....	N
Also, we haven't had a chance to speak since THAT week.	N
and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.	N
Yeah - I have that effect on people.	M
I don't think you should tell her she doesn't have blood...	M
Well, I don't think that store dick is gonna want this.	N
I guess I'm just no good?	N
Trying to get something real by telling yourself stories is a trap.	M
He was conceived during one of our rituals.	M
Die screaming motherfucker.	M
You stay away from my wife, my life, my home, and my skunk!	M
Let's snuff the sucka.	M
Made the semi-finals, didn't you?	N
We are grateful for the time we have been given.	M
Thanks for giving me this part, Mr. Cunningham.	N
I promise, that one day, everything's going to be better for you.	M
You can't argue about taste.	M
All I ever wanted was a single thing worth fighting for.	M
You'd be surprised about what you can get, if you ask for it the right way.	M
Miss Winston, EVERYBODY has a secret face!	M
Even if it's just banging its head against a rock.	N
I don't think I'll ever dry out.	M
Stern, if this factory ever produces a shell that can actually be fired, I'll be very unhappy.	M
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....	N
We get to go home at 7:55.	N
Damn it, you're on a need-to-know basis, and you don't need to know.	M
Anyway, I guess you could say me and Momma was on our own.	N
We've been after this cocksucker for a long time, and tonight we're gonna get him.	N
It woulda been more humane to stake me down and leave me to the crows.	N
Oh, look, look, there's that ... that's -that's my old house.	N
This is pricks ficks.	N
I wish there was some way I could just pay the fine and go home.	M
It's going to be a long spring.	M
Look at this: an entire generation of Cinderellas and there's no glass slipper.	M
You know, all things considered, Data, I think you have nicer eyes.	M
I sawed the main beam in half.	N
Oh, man, this isn't happening, it only thinks its happening.	M
What the hell you doin', Grace?	N
Mal shoots him in the head, turns back.	N
Only second chance I know, is the chance to make the same mistake twice.	M
The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see?	N
What do I have to do to prove to you that I'm not a killer?	M
where's the happy little tire swing?	M
Tell me... do you like music, Mr. Finch?	M
Come on, Louise, don't blow it.	M
Here she stopped and, closing her eyes, took a deep breath of the flower-scented air of the broad expanse around her.	N
Guess old Melissa found what she was looking for.	M
Don't they ever stop migrating?	M
I don't know what I'm doing.	M
I'm sure it won't be that hard.	N
You weren't getting out of buying those beers that easy.	N
We've got to get bail.	N
Shut up and fly straight!	M
And what do you think you're going to do?	N
Your partner told me he was under the weather.	N
And I'm BACK IN THE GAME!	M
You know your head ain't on straight?	M
She ransacked her own room, and I fell for it!	M
Oh, I think we're going to have several.	N
May the forks be with us.	M
She's a good woman, Louise.	N
I'm supposed to install a firewall on his system-	N
His will to live is very strong.	M
I want you to exit this guy off the premises, I want you to exit him off his feet and I want you to use his head to open the fucking door.	M
A person doesn't change just because you find out more.	M
I will not give him up to them.	N
Don't come back, either.	N
You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.	N
Three weeks ago, all I thought about was... well I didn't actually think about anything.	M
I shall trade you the Compass, if you will help me... to find this.	N
No doubt they're as foul as the stuff you set on your table....	N
If there's one thing this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have it.	M
That's the nice thing about them.	N
And if someone like me doesn't write it, where they gonna get it?	N
Shit on my dick, or blood on my knife?	M
First time, shame on you.	N
I'm not working for any other paper!	N
A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.	N
What does it mean, "exact change"?	M
You just stay in the car and watch and be ready.	N
That gives me a very secure feeling.	N
He should join the Marines, they could make something out of him.	N
I'm surprised you're available.	N
What are you gunna do about it up in your fucking high window with your goddamn binoculars?	M
You're in the middle of a police station.	N
Mr. President, I have come to speak on behalf of the accused.	N
How are we going to explain to Brick Top that his fight isn't going to .	N
We are here for your protection and safety.	N
Inside the packet you'll find a clearly worked out severance package.	N
I've never credited the Alliance with an overabundance of brains and if you're the best they've got...	M
Why don't you just shove a leash up my ass?	M
You know, a good cop will never let you know he knows you're full of shit.	M
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?	N
Well, I think we should just make our delivery as soon as possible, don't you?	N
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.	N
Get out of my facial!	M
Yeah, well, that's a Hazard of the jjj...	N
We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.	N
We've got to get a new travel agent.	M
How terrible is wisdom, when it brings no profit to the wise.	M
I am a leaf on the wind - watch how I soar.	M
The Batbook is pecking at his eyes!	N
Well... You can want in one hand and shit in the other, and see which one fills first.	M
It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-	N
In the future, when a woman is crying like that, she isn't having any fun.	M
See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.	N
I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.	N
I'd like to kill the freaking guy who broke this mirror.	M
Put these clothes on!	N
We can't hold out forever Kup, but we *can* give them one *humongous* repair bill.	M
What is it that your worried about, looking bad at the P.T.A?	M
So you can take us to St. Rose.	N
We'll tear your soul apart!	M
It'd be as well to let it go.	N
Tell me your last name.	N
Just tell me what's really going on.	N
She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother.	M
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.	M
A toast to my big brother George: The richest man in town.	M
I've always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.	M
Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!	N
You must know which one it is, you sat there for over a year.	N
Anna Crowe, I am in love... in love I am.	M
Everyone that she plays with dies.	M
No, no, Marvin, it's fine really.	N
But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you.	N
You gave it to those Wall Street bastards?	M
You were the only audience I ever needed.	M
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-	N
Then my lads, eternal life shall by ours!	N
You couldn't hit a lake if you were standing on the bottom.	M
Why can't you all just die and leave me alone?	M
Tell her what happened - Everything.	N
I guess I never looked at it like that before.	N
Aren't we saying cocaine is more potent than our Constitution?	N
Of course, in Alabama the Tuscaloosa, but that's entirely irrelephant.	N
I shall not be caged like some animal	N
So, you know where I am...and now I know where you are, Anna Ivanovna.	M
And strip everything you don't need out of the planes.	N
Did you ever try to run in high heels?	N
There are some days when I actually love it.	N
It's all right, I know I'm being insane.	N
That's right, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake!	N
Between take-off and landing, we have our time together, but that's all we get.	N
You know, you could have some really fun backyard get-togethers out here.	N
Just a matter of time, I suppose.	M
Yeah, this is the haute cuisine of garments.	M
You never know, lightning could strike.	M
You don't have to tell me your secret if you don't want to.	N
Why don't y'all go back to your *own* cabin, if you want to play with C.W.	M
Mr. Jacks nods, heads for home.	N
Kirill, we don't kill little babies.	M
Where did you pick up that cheap trick?	M
You have taken your first step into a larger world.	N
I'd like to think that the last thing that went through his head, other than that bullet, was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.	M
My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.	M
It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy.	N
It's a business lie, it's different from a life lie.	M
Life is just a dream on the way to death.	M
But the false promise of a new dawn usually leads to a most bloody sunset.	M
Hey, porky pig, I hope you get molested.	M
He's got to... All these years, runnin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him... Now we caught up...	N
Majorek, this is the greatest pianist in Poland, maybe the whole world.	M
Let's be able to say we were the ones who put peer pressure out to pasture.	N
Look at him... That's my brother god damnit.	M
He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.	N
Don't you just love New York in the fall?	M
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.	N
I know it's been a tough ordeal... with the trial and everything.	N
My husband's dead, isn't he?	N
Look Ah this isn't really necessary.	N
It went straight for the warhead, and they think it's cute.	M
And now, your highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base...	M
We'll divide into teams.	N
We have had security problems and to cut a long story short, I need another seven million Euros lost in the books.	N
Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack.	M
Sixty thou a year, domestic.	N
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!	N
I'm not running -- not from you.	N
She's only a ship, mate.	M
If this is all a dream, why can't there be more girls?	M
Tell him I couldn't read his lips.	N
Only bad witches are ugly.	M
So sharp, you won't feel a thing...	M
This maniac should be wearing a number, not a badge.	M
Go ahead... take your best shot, motherfucker!	M
The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --	N
All right buddy, that's it...	N
Bring in the logic probe!	M
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.	N
I am Jack's smirking revenge.	M
Then I suggest you go home and do the same.	N
Mr. Hammond, the phones are working.	M
Yes, things are going quite well.	N
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago.	N
She had lovers, but she saved that for marriage.	N
Why, I'm so scared, I'm so scared, I'm so scared, wo-o-o!	M
And I always thought THESE were gonna kill me.	M
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.	N
Don't make a sound unless I say.	N
Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you.	N
We got a dollar ninety-eight, and you're laughing!	M
Why did I kill all the others?	N
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?	N
We're just good patriotic Americans like yourself.	N
We'll be comin' for you tonight, sister.	N
I consider myself a nerd.	M
That's my new favorite camel.	M
Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play.	N
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.	M
"The multiplying villainies of nature do swarm upon him  disdaining fortune/with his brandish'd steel, which smoked with bloody execution...?	M
Look, it's okay for me to shit in the street, but *you* gotta use a toilet.	M
All you need is love, John Lennon, smart man, shot in the back very sad.	M
Jesus, George, it was a wonder I was even born.	M
It does what ever the fuck I tell it to do!	N
<u>All</u> restaurants are now Taco Bell.	N
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.	N
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?	M
Mark, this isn't some kind of jo...	N
Monsieur LaPadite, to both your family and your cows I say: Bravo.	M
Oh, God, I'm so ashamed!	M
Hey, Cherita... want a cigarette?	N
They went with someone who had more theme-park experience.	M
I took the bread.	N
Repeat drunk drivers, and I'm gonna get 'em all off.	N
He broke out of a metal hospital.	N
My boy's wicked smart.	M
I can't stand these things... it's like drinking coffee through a veil.	M
Go Back to China, bitch.	M
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics.	M
I have therefore classified him a hostage of the war criminal known as Nero.	N
No matter what happened to you.	N
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours.	N
Oh, Nicky, I love you because you know such lovely people.	M
General, count me in.	M
These are fossilized bone fragments I've been able to study, gathered from the bomb site in Dallas...	N
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.	N
I go to orgies, I catch everything...	N
I have worked out a little more of our plan.	N
Your dad has gone too far, Kirill.	N
It's better if we do this together.	N
Tell me how old you are, Eddie.	N
I was 27 years old the first time I died.	M
These men may be the only defense you've got.	N
My ass may be dumb, but I ain't no dumbass.	M
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.	N
Reject the basic assumptions of civilization, especially the importance of material possessions.	M
Stick 'em in the bushes for now.	N
That was some of the best flying I've seen to date - right up to the part where you got killed.	M
We didn't even know she had been taken hostage.	N
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.	M
It won't affect me, I'm already a woman.	M
The east side is always faster.	N
I'm not dying in a fucking rat maze!	M
Now there's an intelligently biting remark wrought with wit and irony.	M
We mortals have many weaknesses; we feel too much, hurt too much or too soon we die, but we do have the chance of love.	M
And so she walked out of our lives forever.	M
That's what I ask and that's what I care about, get out of my office.	N
Not in the mood, I guess.	N
I got all this information illegally.	N
Andy Dufresne - who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side.	M
Drink with your brains, that's our motto.	M
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!	N
You're too slow, old man.	M
I like to understand what I'm shown.	M
The guy was a total fruitcake.	N
Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red light!	N
Was never no beating under Mr. Garner.	N
The perfect nuclear family.	N
We can't let those gang-bangers get away, man...	N
Next time, remind me to do this outside.	M
Sorry we were gone so long, but we had to pick up Hank!	M
You look so much more attractive when you're self- assured.	N
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothin'.	M
Searching for a money man...	N
Alright, stand back you pedestrians, this ain't no automobile accident.	M
Sometimes it's a hard world for small things.	M
Extra Cheese is two dollars.	M
Well, I am the last person to persuade you, but don't do it blindly... if this is your decision, you must be prepared to face the consequences...	N
When somebody asks me a question, I tell them the answer.	M
She's tapping Kara, and Kara knows you know me.	N
Why do they always run?	M
That's a lot of fish.	M
Once or twice more and we're going to be dead in space.	N
When it's ready, my body will just push it out.	M
I can't wait to see afternoon.	N
And here I made you all hot and sweaty...	M
I'm not jello!	N
I don't think that there's anything worse than being ordinary.	M
Oh, God, get me out.	N
There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...	N
She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!	N
Schmucks are people too.	M
You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead.	N
She kept yammering all the time, but her hips were doing all the talking.	M
It's time we were away.	N
These are the first-born sons of Gotham City!	N
As a matter of fact, a small tropical island, in the South Pacific, about 300 nautical miles south-southwest of Fiji.	N
This is simply a reflection of my appreciation.	N
I can't run with you, Mickey!	N
Well, if it doesn't jell, it isn't aspic, and this ain't jellin'!	M
Have you seen a little dog?	N
Just open it up, let the woman out.	N
And then we all smiled, and it was a great minute.	N
I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.	N
You makin' a nigga fall hard, man...	M
Wipe your face before you get up Dean.	M
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.	N
Some weird fuckin' shit, eh, Bud?	M
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.	N
Me, Grimlock, want to munch metal.	M
I don't want to get you drunk, but, ah, that's a very fine Chardonnay you're not drinking.	M
I don't give a flying handshake what your name is.	M
Never fear, Smith is here.	M
Depends on the woman I marry.	N
I was responsible... in some way...	N
If you piss in your pants, you only stay warm for so long.	M
Professor Marvel never guesses, he knows!	M
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.	M
E-mail is for geeks and pedophiles.	M
A toast, to the end of the world.	M
I've been in love with you since I was eleven, and the shit won't go away.	M
You didn't straighten the place up, did you?	N
The Emperor's made a critical error, and the time for our attack has come.	M
Let it shine, shine, shine, All around the world!!	N
They've been shaking their ass for two minutes!	M
You think I did good?	N
She's a little pissed off right now but...	N
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills Guy.	M
Frank Wheeler, I think you're the most interesting person I've ever met.	M
I avoided capture by using your Mak'tar stealth haze.	M
I think it was a simple case of wanting to be a man again after all that abortion business.	N
Not interrupting anything, I hope.	N
There is no place for excuses when you are the LEADER!	M
Cannot get good help these days.	N
You make every day feel like kindergarten.	M
After fighting, everything else in your life got the volume turned down.	M
Well I don't know I mean that's pretty severe.	N
...And this man on the hill comes.	N
We have to make it down to the bottom.	N
Thank you for talking about me behind my back - that'll be useful in court.	M
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left.	N
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget that I run a business?	M
'Cause they're sheep -- and the sheep get slaughtered.	N
You shouldn't be callin' people lousy little shrimps, Oscar, unless you're referrin' to the family resemblance in your brother here.	M
I'm just a half mile from here.	N
Maybe I'll just sit here and bleed at you.	M
Mind where you shoot, boys!	N
What family he had tended to... not survive.	N
If your only faith is science, doctor, it may be you that's laid to rest.	M
John Connor... We gotta find this guy.	M
Forgive me, I'm blowing your mind.	M
No way they could stop it.	N
And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.	N
Now get out of the car and shoot him in the head!	M
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.	N
We have to shut them down...	N
...aced those guys that tried to kill us!	N
You're not a tipsomaniac at your age?	M
I am the soul of discretion.	M
It's what you are that's being denied and denied and denied in this kind of life.	N
There never was, and there never will be, another like you.	M
What kind of mother can't stand her own son?	M
With you as her mother her father could be anybody in Actors' Equity!	N
You stomp around like a forties drunk and you're a lousy shot.	N
So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me.	N
That how you gonna stand?	N
When I was in China on the All-American Ping Pong team, I just loved playing ping-pong with my Flexolite ping pong paddle.	M
Even in hell I get no respect.	M
The guide book was written by a bunch of lazy good-for-nothing Indian beggars!	M
We ain't gonna bring Nike to their knees with some regional camel ad --	N
Well, to tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.	M

My playpen used to be in her studio.	N
Everybody take your seatsl Col.Landa, Lt.Aldo, and Bridget are still together.	N
What is the point of living in L.A. if you're not in the movie business?	M
Me and him's made friends.	N
Well, I think we should start searching for your son.	N
It's not you I don't trust.	N
I can't get much wetter.	N
We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.	N
You are hanging on by a very thin thread and I dig that about you!	M

An honest man is always in trouble, remember that Simon.	M
Ask Bianca who drove her home	N
OK, last one to kill a bad guy buys the beer.	M
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.	N
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.	N
You don't wanna talk, tell me to fuck off...	N
Now all we need... is skin.	M
Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you.	N
I feel like an idiot fainting in a stranger's office.	M
What's wrong with being a large mammal?	M
No fire, I beg you.	N
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...	N
Mission control to Chuck, come in...	N
That sex was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.	M
Don't give me any of that intelligent life crap, just give me something I can blow up	M
What does he know about man alone?	M
I haven't been nice to you.	N
All you need is love.	M
Issue a standing kill order on Jason Bourne, effective immediately.	M
I don't care so long as he's not a freak.	N
Your eyes can deceive you; don't trust them.	M
Ah -- now we've got them!	N
I'll probably shit blood tonight.	M
Has somebody come to town!	M
I believe the mind is the best weapon.	N
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!	M
Morgan, the guy from 23, right?	N
I'm tired and emotional.	M
After Lewton, you should've been next.	N
Before we let you leave, your commander must cross that field, present himself before this army, put his head between his legs, and kiss his own arse.	M
I despise a floggin' rooster.	M

He's not drunk, Mom, he's just eccentric.	M
Well, he didn't say in so many words that ever since you started with that house you haven't turned in a decent piece of copy, but --	N
That's just the sort of thing my father and I discussed.	N
My enemy's enemy is a friend.	M
As you observed, a primitive Culture.	N
I want a home and children and peace.	N
And now, young Skywalker... you will die.	M
When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.	N
I can do it by the way.	N
Is it safe to say that the person who inflicted this wound intended to kill?	M
I just think us girls should stick together.	N
Have you ever tried to pick up your teeth with broken fingers?	M
I'll tell you the greatest regret of my life: I let my love go.	M

I kinda feel like God.	M
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu.	N
Who told them of the key?	N
Well, this looks like the end of a terrible friendship.	M
I'm getting a little dizzy, I can feel my heart pumping --	N
Gentlemen upstage; ladies downstage... Are you a lady Mr. Kent?	M
How are my boys, Bill?	N
The guy's been in town two days, and already he thinks he's David O. Fucking Selznick.	M
...remarkable that his 'Faith Factory' is being financed by an entire nation's indigestion.	N
I don't know about you, Miss Kitty, but I feel so much yummier.	M
I think you might have said something like that.	N
Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town.	M
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.	M
I'm upset, Maria.	N
If he could've that's what he would have said.	N
Rose is displeased... what to do?	M
You tell *Her Majesty* that if her husband were here he'd tell her to get out of the house and get some air into her lungs.	M
These guys are about as much fun as a tax audit.	M
He made it to the road and got hit by a Saracen.	N

We forget about the important things.	N
I think she was a passenger on our last voyage.	N
I don't want to lose my virginity to a piece of fruit.	M
You mean like, strip strip?	N
Her pussy gets so wet you can't believe it.	M
Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.	N
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.	M
We have come to visit you in peace and with goodwill.	M
My professional opinion is that you've managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.	M
Bring a James Bond for me and my boy Mikey, and if you tell the bartender to go easy on the water... ...this Kennedy has your name on it.	N
That's one of the good things about Paris: lots of girls willing to take their clothes off.	M
Sometimes the shit comes down so heavy I feel like I should wear a hat.	M
And even governments don't go to war with him.	N
Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration.	N

I wouldn't give you a gun if it were World War 3.	M
Please don't give him any more acid.	M
You're right on the money, Julie.	N
This one time, at band camp, I stuck a flute in my pussy.	M
Who is that guy in the Rec Room?	N
It's been a pleasure chatting with a fellow cinema lover.	M
I got a tree on my back and a haint in my house, and nothing inbetween but the daughter I'm holding in my arms.	M
I didn't mean to call you a meat loaf, Jack!	M
Think before you drink before you drive me mad.	M
Now let me ask you a question: Would an imbecile come up with this?	M
Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we shall send you back to Stratford to your wife!	M
Your shift is over.	N
In the dream, she was standing in a room.	N
I never did give you that--	N
And we were dressed from head to toe in love... the only label that never goes out of style.	M
Peace and quiet is for libraries!	M
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?	N
I could, like, kill a guy with these things.	M
What with all the attention the newspapers and television has been giving you, you'd think you were the Pope or something.	M
I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.	N
...that your ransom video already has 47,000 hits on YouTube.	M
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.	M
Why does God need a starship?	M
would you page my daughter Brigitte please?	N
How was work, mommy?	N
They say there are only two days you enjoy a boat; the day you buy it and the day you sell it.	M

Lenny, I've always considered you the Dutch Elm disease in my family tree.	M
We're not here to solve the case of the missing scumbag, we're here to nail Costello.	M
Jesus, Jim -- if we don't make it -- if we miss the REMO...	N
I'll be leaving in ten minutes.	N
Perhaps your kettles are stained with rust.	N
...Days of watching my children sleep away the morning...And taking care of my baby like it was the most important thing I had to do...	N
All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David.	N
When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.	N
Oh, why don't you go home?	N
I think that kids get bored and have intercourse.	M
Every man dies, not every man really lives.	M
But I think once you quit hearing "sir" and "ma'am," the rest is soon to foller.	M
George Clews is in town.	N
I have some cold duck on ice for the occasion.	N
Ensign Authorization code: nine-five-wictor-wictor-two!	M

If you open that trunk, they go inside.	M
You must be the 'Red Dragon'!	M
Jesus Christ, what happened?	M
Where I come from we think of this as Eden.	N
This used to be a nice neighborhood.	N
A reality check courtesy of my boot in your ass.	N
You didn't expect me to come down in my bathrobe, did you?	M
This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry!	N
You know -- I think sometimes you say things that mean something other than what you're actually saying.	N

I think I'll miss you most of all.	M
You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...	N
He teach you to do it?	N
One tires of being executed.	M
I don't know; every man has his breaking point.	M
The door from the patio, in back.	N
Madam, you are a cock-eyed liar!	M
Check into a hotel, order up some champagne, I'll finish up my business and ...	N
Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?	N

What in god's name was going through your mind, son?	N
Billy wants to change, too, Clarice.	N
Reverse Darwinism - survival of the most idiotic.	M
Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.	N

So, do you want my signed confession now, or after coffee?	M
What are you, Jimmy Olsen, cub reporter for the Daily Asshole?	M
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?	N
You really have no clue how beautiful you are, do you?	M
The last time I had a pap smear, the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.	M
You have the bridge... Mr. Troi.	M
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.	N
I wonder how many steaks I could make out of you?	M
I don't want FOP Damn it, I'm a Dapper Dan Man!	M
Then when the enemy approaches we'll say, "Come in, gentlemen - what can we do for you?	N

Do you know how lucky we are to have found each other?	N
If there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.	M
Come to see the show?	M

I'd like to spell it out for you... only I can't spell!	M
...wondering if I could come down to Savannah to see her, and that's what I'm doing here.	N
Ben, if you mixed drinks that way you mixed metaphors, you'd be out of a job...	M
I have always pictured them, in some ways, as our protectors.	N
Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.	N
Spat on the floor as I walked by.	N
You'd have to have a lot of tape for my story.	N
Michael, why are the drapes open?	M

Since when is LAPD working for the Feebs?	M
How long have you known him, Bob?	N
I'm interested in the antigens here, the agglutination reaction --	N
I'll have to clear it.	N
We married in secret because I would not share her with an English lord.	N
Shh, Shh, I can't tell you now.	N
They are my children and all I want to do is love them.	N
I have decided that we shall stay here.	M
And now you're all grown up -- and I'm - uh - um --	N
As soon as I heard about the wall, I spoke to him and he decided you had to go.	N
I am Ard... Supreme Leader of The Revolution and Next Ruler of The World.	M
Every man has a price he will willingly accept, even for what he hoped never to sell.	M

Listen to me, you great big bubble-headed baboon!	M
Welcome to Wonderland, Alice.	M
Admiral, there be whales here!	M
I'm sorry, I just came by to thank you for WRECKING MY LIFE!	M
All right, I'm gonna punch his ticket in.	M
I eat the pussy, I eat the butt, I eat every motherfuckin' thang.	M
Now just where do you suppose he cut her up?	N
I felt sorry for all the guys packing into gyms, trying to look like what Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger said they should.	N
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on.	N
Send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!	N
Well, if you change your minds, I know where we can get one hundred beef, seventy-five fish and twenty- five vegetarian meals.	N
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.	N
This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.	N
Oh, he's a lover, man... definitely loves what he does for a living.	M
What's it look like!	N
You have the bridge, Commander.	N
Great pate, mom, but I gotta motor if I wanna be ready for that party tonight.	M
I'm ready to communicate with you now.	M
I don't expect an apology and I don't even want one.	N
You bet on me like I bet on you.	M
The cops tell the eyewitnesses, "Don't doubt your ID, we got 'em dead on the gun.	N
Yeah, but Saul, he's a fucking drug dealer.	N

Are you ready for my wisdom?	M
Kids... always a disappointment.	M
Look at my face; I'm not very mad.	M
You take yourself out of the game, you start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream and of course it's going to end up on the friendship tip.	M
You gonna tell me the difference between this guy and that guy is luck?	M
I see you've managed to get your shirt off.	M
No one's forcing you to listen.	N
Tell that fuckin' Pepe if he's switching stones on us, he'd better take a fucking camel back to Nigeria.	M
They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...	N
So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.	N
May I see her?	N
Did you say my mother gave you a hand job?	N
That's the most I've ever lifted.	N
No offence, Professor Tripp, but you look kinda crappy.	M
That said, let's not get too stupid tonight, okay?	N
I like them French fried potaters.	M
Well, I didn't think you would sleep with a guy like Lumbergh!	N
Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous.	M
I can't be worrying about that shit.	N
I should have been upset about my nice, neat, flaming little shit.	N
When you're hanging on by your fingernails, you can't go waving your arms around.	M
The width of the arms of the Star must be one centimetre.	N
Now you can have yours.	N
It smells like shit in here?	N
I won't let it happen, okay?	M
"Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on.	N

You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it?	N
When I want your opinion, I'll beat it out of you.	M
Here's a man you should meet, Mr. Fabian.	N
I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?	N
That's all I have to say about that.	M
Dylan... until mommy gets back... whatever you do don't fall asleep.	M
I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.	N
Thank you for loving me.	M
You go to hell, you pervert!	N
You can't trust Melanie but you can trust Melanie to be Melanie.	M
Because if you are...	N
I was therefore by definition only partially frozen.	N
Supposin' we get killed in there - it could be hours before he's discovered.	N
Come get me if you love me baby.	N
When he's gone the family business will be yours.	N
Shut the fuck up, Donny.	M
You kids ought to go up to bed.	N
For the last five months I've been thinking that it's a huge mistake that you left Steve.	N

It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.	M

I'll show you collateral damage!	M
I think the very name of Paris brought a rush of pleasure to me that was extraordinary.	N
I'm sure the lady knows her own mind.	N

What is your damage, Heather?	M
Make your kid a orphan before he's born.	N
Goddamn, motherfucker got blood all over my best clown suit.	M
There will be others involved and I cannot-ask them to accept such a risk for less.	N
That's because you keep reminding me.	N

Your English is getting good... You're showing it off.	N
Let me fix you some sandwiches...	M
Who would like to buy some aspirin?	M
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.	N
A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.	N
In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.	N
Actually, my friend will pronounce you dead shortly and I thought I might keep him company.	N
And just what exactly are the Chinese doing here in the middle of the American desert anyway?...	N
