What's this all about, Tyler?	N
I - I don't know, Bill.	N
All I know is... you're beautiful.	M
If there's anything around here more important than my ego, I want it caught and shot now!	M
Hang on tightly, let go lightly.	M
It was our money and we want it back.	N
Archie is *not* fucking Mr. Weatherbee!	M
Lucius Hunt you answer me this moment!	N
Au contraire baby, you can't resist me.	M
The first and most important rule of gun-running is: Never get shot with your own merchandise.	M
I always thought I knew the punchline.	N
These men are the leaders of a terrorist organization wanted for the abduction of a monkey.	N
And I'd gladly stand up; next to you and defend her still today.	N
You'd make a good poker player, kid.	M
L.A.P.D., I mean San Angeles P.D.	N
The two hours after school and before The Rockford Files, three days in a row.	N
See this is why we're not watching TV, people become obsessed.	M
I mean, he was already in Vegas a couple of years and he had the fuckin' place clocked.	N
Why'd you have to get us into this, Foxy?	N
Would it help if I explained to them I'm not homosexual?	N
NOBODY'S GONNA PUT ME TO SLEEP!	N
Well, kiddo, I thought you outgrew superstition.	M
I have a special surprise for you, Mommy!	M
Sammy, opening for David Brenner is a fine gig.	N
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?	N
Don't matter what kin' either.	N
Now, on top of everything else, I gotta make sure no one fucks around with the Golden Jew.	M
Oh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.	N
Captain, shall we raise our shields?	N
What is your malfunction, you fat barrel of monkey spunk?	M
Goddamn, these people are confusing.	M
But I knew if anyone could straighten them out, you could.	N
Don't worry Jennie.	N
Joe College strikes out.	M
I just wish I understood what they were telling me.	N
We fell from grace together.	N
I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.	N
I have worked out a little more of our plan.	N
Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting for him to pick us up...	N
We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.	N
Nobody appreciates that kind of integrity anymore... the grain, the gritty look you get.	N
The east side is always faster.	N
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is?	N
I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.	N
... and then, you know, you grow up.	N
You used to ride with that guy?	M
Man, they got a shit load of cookies!	M
I was making time with your girl.	N
They abide, and they endure.	M
Don't be a fool!	N
My eyes still hurt from reading that movie.	M
You, madam, are addressing a man, who is in fact quiet... and yet, not quiet, if I may offer to you a riddle.	M
Does my inner child need a spanking?	M
I'd be monarch of all I survey....	N
Yeah - I have that effect on people.	M
I don't think you should tell her she doesn't have blood...	M
Well, I don't think that store dick is gonna want this.	N
I guess I'm just no good?	N
He was conceived during one of our rituals.	M
Die screaming motherfucker.	M
You stay away from my wife, my life, my home, and my skunk!	M
Let's snuff the sucka.	M
Made the semi-finals, didn't you?	N
We are grateful for the time we have been given.	M
This is the coolest thing I have ever seen.	M
Thanks for giving me this part, Mr. Cunningham.	N
I promise, that one day, everything's going to be better for you.	M
You can't argue about taste.	M
Billy, take the radio, leave the rest.	N
Miss Winston, EVERYBODY has a secret face!	M
Even if it's just banging its head against a rock.	N
Stern, if this factory ever produces a shell that can actually be fired, I'll be very unhappy.	M
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....	N
Come with me if you want to live!	M
We get to go home at 7:55.	N
I don't think this is the lightning you're looking for.	M
Damn it, you're on a need-to-know basis, and you don't need to know.	M
Anyway, I guess you could say me and Momma was on our own.	N
I just love the feel of tuck and roll upholstery.	N
We've been after this cocksucker for a long time, and tonight we're gonna get him.	N
Oh, you amuse me, Roy, but I'm the only woman in America born after World War II that thinks astrology's a crock of shit.	M
It woulda been more humane to stake me down and leave me to the crows.	N
Oh, look, look, there's that ... that's -that's my old house.	N
This is pricks ficks.	N
I wish there was some way I could just pay the fine and go home.	M
It's going to be a long spring.	M
Look at this: an entire generation of Cinderellas and there's no glass slipper.	M
You know, all things considered, Data, I think you have nicer eyes.	M
I sawed the main beam in half.	N
Oh, man, this isn't happening, it only thinks its happening.	M
There are some mistakes you cannot risk when you have children.	M
Just going to the kitchen to get some food, then I'm going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins.	M
What the hell you doin', Grace?	N
Only second chance I know, is the chance to make the same mistake twice.	M
The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see?	N
But the false promise of a new dawn usually leads to a most bloody sunset.	M
Tell me... do you like music, Mr. Finch?	M
Well, I guess that's the way life works, isn't it?	N
Guess old Melissa found what she was looking for.	M
His name is the Count De Rochefort.	N
Don't they ever stop migrating?	M
I don't know what I'm doing.	M
You weren't getting out of buying those beers that easy.	N
This kind of murder...	N
I'm interested in the antigens here, the agglutination reaction --	N
Look kid, why don't you go out and win a few races, then come back and see me.	N
This doesn't make any sense.	M
And I'm BACK IN THE GAME!	M
You know your head ain't on straight?	M
Come on up and watch TV.	M
She ransacked her own room, and I fell for it!	M
Oh, I think we're going to have several.	N
May the forks be with us.	M
I'm supposed to install a firewall on his system-	N
His will to live is very strong.	M
I want you to exit this guy off the premises, I want you to exit him off his feet and I want you to use his head to open the fucking door.	M
A person doesn't change just because you find out more.	M
I will not give him up to them.	N
Don't come back, either.	N
You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.	N
Three weeks ago, all I thought about was... well I didn't actually think about anything.	M
I shall trade you the Compass, if you will help me... to find this.	N
No doubt they're as foul as the stuff you set on your table....	N
If there's one thing this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have it.	M
That's the nice thing about them.	N
And if someone like me doesn't write it, where they gonna get it?	N
Well, you didn't think I forgot about you, did you?	M
No -- don't you see -- crawling --	N
Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?	N
Bring in that floating fat man, the Baron!	M
What are you gunna do about it up in your fucking high window with your goddamn binoculars?	M
How are we going to explain to Brick Top that his fight isn't going to .	N
We are here for your protection and safety.	N
Eileen -- I didn't know you were that kinda girl!	N
I've never credited the Alliance with an overabundance of brains and if you're the best they've got...	M
It's not contaminated, you don't even know what that word means.	M
You know, a good cop will never let you know he knows you're full of shit.	M
Nothing is permanent, not even death.	M
I'm not sure I agree with you a hundred percent on your police work, there, Lou.	M
Yeah, well, that's a Hazard of the jjj...	N
It was nice to see you again, Ally.	N
We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.	N
We've got to get a new travel agent.	M
How terrible is wisdom, when it brings no profit to the wise.	M
I am a leaf on the wind - watch how I soar.	M
The Batbook is pecking at his eyes!	N
Well... You can want in one hand and shit in the other, and see which one fills first.	M
I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things.	N
I'd like to kill the freaking guy who broke this mirror.	M
Put these clothes on!	N
We can't hold out forever Kup, but we *can* give them one *humongous* repair bill.	M
What is it that your worried about, looking bad at the P.T.A?	M
So you can take us to St. Rose.	N
Sleep is for the weak Mr. President.	M
It'd be as well to let it go.	N
Kids - 10 seconds of joy, 30 years of misery.	M
The first step is love, the second is mercy.	M
What if Bo's baby monitor is picking up signals from the extraterrestrials?	N
She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother.	M
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.	M
A toast to my big brother George: The richest man in town.	M
I've always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.	M
Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!	N
Anna Crowe, I am in love... in love I am.	M
Everyone that she plays with dies.	M
No, no, Marvin, it's fine really.	N
But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you.	N
You gave it to those Wall Street bastards?	M
Sicker 'n' a dog, that's for sure.	M
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-	N
Thus with a kiss I die.	M
Maybe he'll adopt me.	M
I'd rather fight with you than make love with anyone else.	M
Tell her what happened - Everything.	N
I'd keep my promises if I were you.	M
Aren't we saying cocaine is more potent than our Constitution?	N
Of course, in Alabama the Tuscaloosa, but that's entirely irrelephant.	N
Did you ever try to run in high heels?	N
There are some days when I actually love it.	N
Can you try and reach into my left jacket pocket?	N
That's right, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake!	N
I want to know everyone you've met for the last twenty years.	N
I don't, I didn't -- I met this girl earlier, Minnie Tyco?	N
Between take-off and landing, we have our time together, but that's all we get.	N
You know, you could have some really fun backyard get-togethers out here.	N
Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing.	M
Yeah, this is the haute cuisine of garments.	M
You don't have to tell me your secret if you don't want to.	N
Mr. Jacks nods, heads for home.	N
Where did you pick up that cheap trick?	M
You have taken your first step into a larger world.	N
I'd like to think that the last thing that went through his head, other than that bullet, was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.	M
My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.	M
It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy.	N
Chicks cannot hold their smoke, dat's what it is.	M
I've always known I'll die alone.	M
Life is just a dream on the way to death.	M
I already got everything I need from you.	N
Hey, porky pig, I hope you get molested.	M
This mornin' I was talkin' to this stranger up at the boardinghouse.	N
No, but the boat has to be here somewhere!	N
They march you in naked as the day you're born, fresh from a Bible reading, skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit they throw on you...	N
Let's be able to say we were the ones who put peer pressure out to pasture.	N
What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"?	M
He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.	N
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.	N
I know it's been a tough ordeal... with the trial and everything.	N
My husband's dead, isn't he?	N
The broads're probably lining up right now, waiting for ol' Ty and his buddy Stump.	N
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and so inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?	M
Hasta la vista, baby.	M
Look Ah this isn't really necessary.	N
And then, Black Beauty couldn't take it any longer and he finally did some of his own mounting.	M
If anyone needs me, I'll be in the Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen.	M
I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but..	N
The Indian used campfires.	N
We have had security problems and to cut a long story short, I need another seven million Euros lost in the books.	N
Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack.	M
As long as you have that, they know where you are.	N
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!	N
The fool thought he had duplicated the moment of creation.	N
I'm not running -- not from you.	N
She's only a ship, mate.	M
If this is all a dream, why can't there be more girls?	M
I think I just came... didn't you feel it?	M
You're the one who's in a hurry, aren't you?	N
Tell him I couldn't read his lips.	N
Only bad witches are ugly.	M
I'm paying people just to wait for you.	N
I didn't come this far to be breakfast.	M
This maniac should be wearing a number, not a badge.	M
Yeah, so did you, Bernstein.	N
Go ahead... take your best shot, motherfucker!	M
Bring in the logic probe!	M
Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger... That's what I do, I swing.	N
I am Jack's smirking revenge.	M
Then I suggest you go home and do the same.	N
Mr. Hammond, the phones are working.	M
That's the last time I leave you in charge.	M
Yes, things are going quite well.	N
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago.	N
Today I saw a slave become more powerful than the Emperor of Rome.	M
We're not gonna have a war, we're gonna have the appearance of a war.	M
You know how women lie.	M
Why, I'm so scared, I'm so scared, I'm so scared, wo-o-o!	M
Lately, your low self-esteem is just good common sense.	M
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.	N
Don't make a sound unless I say.	N
Why did I kill all the others?	N
You are in a position unsuitable to give orders.	M
Excuse me, but what are you talking about?	N
We're just good patriotic Americans like yourself.	N
I consider myself a nerd.	M
Is the colonel's underwear a matter of national security?	M
Even Lieutenant Dan would come and watch me play.	N
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.	M
"The multiplying villainies of nature do swarm upon him  disdaining fortune/with his brandish'd steel, which smoked with bloody execution...?	M
Look, it's okay for me to shit in the street, but *you* gotta use a toilet.	M
All you need is love, John Lennon, smart man, shot in the back very sad.	M
Sure don't look none too prosperous.	M
It does what ever the fuck I tell it to do!	N
<u>All</u> restaurants are now Taco Bell.	N
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.	N
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?	M
Mark, this isn't some kind of jo...	N
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.	N
Like I care about your shit.	N
Hey, Cherita... want a cigarette?	N
They went with someone who had more theme-park experience.	M
I took the bread.	N
Repeat drunk drivers, and I'm gonna get 'em all off.	N
He broke out of a metal hospital.	N
My boy's wicked smart.	M
I can't stand these things... it's like drinking coffee through a veil.	M
Go Back to China, bitch.	M
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics.	M
I have therefore classified him a hostage of the war criminal known as Nero.	N
No matter what happened to you.	N
Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac.	M
But, if you decide to have the baby, then, at that very instant, when you're absolutely sure... tell him.	N
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels!	M
General, count me in.	M
Mom, this is so not the time to be yourself.	M
I go to orgies, I catch everything...	N
He is the kindest and best of men.	M
It's better if we do this together.	N
I swear I will not kill anyone.	M
Tell me how old you are, Eddie.	N
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.	N
I was 27 years old the first time I died.	M
These men may be the only defense you've got.	N
My ass may be dumb, but I ain't no dumbass.	M
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.	N
Reject the basic assumptions of civilization, especially the importance of material possessions.	M
I've been monitoring their interaction.	N
Stick 'em in the bushes for now.	N
That was some of the best flying I've seen to date - right up to the part where you got killed.	M
We didn't even know she had been taken hostage.	N
I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.	M
It won't affect me, I'm already a woman.	M
I'm not dying in a fucking rat maze!	M
Don't make me take off my sunglasses!	M
Quaffable, but uh... far from transcendent.	M
And so she walked out of our lives forever.	M
That's what I ask and that's what I care about, get out of my office.	N
Not in the mood, I guess.	N
I got all this information illegally.	N
Andy Dufresne - who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side.	M
It's not the sort of responsibility the founding fathers might have recognized.	N
I'll give you a gut feeling, you little... Hey... <u>hey</u>!	N
You're too slow, old man.	M
Come on, suck your finger, you'll be seeing mermaids everywhere!	N
I like to understand what I'm shown.	M
It's Halloween, everyone's entitled to one good scare.	M
Whoaaa -- T-Bird, red light, red light!	N
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals.	M
The perfect nuclear family.	N
We can't let those gang-bangers get away, man...	N
Next time, remind me to do this outside.	M
You look so much more attractive when you're self- assured.	N
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothin'.	M
To get to the other side, and 1 point 772453851.	N
Alright, stand back you pedestrians, this ain't no automobile accident.	M
It's like War of the Worlds.	M
Sometimes it's a hard world for small things.	M
Extra Cheese is two dollars.	M
When somebody asks me a question, I tell them the answer.	M
This guy's a restraining order waiting to happen.	M
She's tapping Kara, and Kara knows you know me.	N
I'm gonna give you an L.A.P.D ass-whuppin'!	M
That's a lot of fish.	M
Once or twice more and we're going to be dead in space.	N
When it's ready, my body will just push it out.	M
How would I know, I mean he lies about everything anyway!	N
And here I made you all hot and sweaty...	M
I don't think that there's anything worse than being ordinary.	M
Oh, God, get me out.	N
Behold, as a wild ass in the desert, go I forth to my work.	M
She's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!	N
Schmucks are people too.	M
She kept yammering all the time, but her hips were doing all the talking.	M
Activate your weirding modules...	N
It's time we were away.	N
Bet the last place you ever go.	N
Death is only the beginning.	M
This is simply a reflection of my appreciation.	N
I can't run with you, Mickey!	N
Well, if it doesn't jell, it isn't aspic, and this ain't jellin'!	M
Have you seen a little dog?	N
Just open it up, let the woman out.	N
And then we all smiled, and it was a great minute.	N
I'd call now but she'll want me to come home and I just might.	N
Welcome to the real world.	M
Wipe your face before you get up Dean.	M
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.	N
I was trying to keep you out of this.	N
She brings you good news.	N
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.	N
Me, Grimlock, want to munch metal.	M
No, don't do that, I had a big lunch.	N
I don't give a flying handshake what your name is.	M
Never fear, Smith is here.	M
Depends on the woman I marry.	N
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.	N
I was responsible... in some way...	N
If you piss in your pants, you only stay warm for so long.	M
Professor Marvel never guesses, he knows!	M
My curiosity is killing me; what are you so rambunctious about tonight?	N
A toast, to the end of the world.	M
Let's put the women and children to bed and go lookin' for dinner!	M
I've been in love with you since I was eleven, and the shit won't go away.	M
OK, so we got a trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, these folks drive by, there's a high-speed pursuit, ends here and then this execution-type deal.	M
The Emperor's made a critical error, and the time for our attack has come.	M
They've been shaking their ass for two minutes!	M
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills Guy.	M
Do not know how many more are in the vicinity but I am taking steps for another visitation.	N
I avoided capture by using your Mak'tar stealth haze.	M
hibb... hibbdy... Maybe I did die in the explosion, you know.	M
I told you, if you ever touch me again, I'll kill you.	M
Not interrupting anything, I hope.	N
I think we'd better run...	N
Cannot get good help these days.	N
I'll torture you so slowly, you'll think it's a career.	M
You make every day feel like kindergarten.	M
After fighting, everything else in your life got the volume turned down.	M
Well I don't know I mean that's pretty severe.	N
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.	M
We have to make it down to the bottom.	N
I got her back for you.	N
I haven't seen her around, and as for who would want to kill Johnny Crunch, line forms to the left.	N
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget that I run a business?	M
'Cause they're sheep -- and the sheep get slaughtered.	N
I'm just a half mile from here.	N
Maybe I'll just sit here and bleed at you.	M
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?	N
Real diamonds in a wig, the world we live in.	M
What family he had tended to... not survive.	N
If your only faith is science, doctor, it may be you that's laid to rest.	M
John Connor... We gotta find this guy.	M
No way they could stop it.	N
And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.	N
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.	N
We have to shut them down...	N
...aced those guys that tried to kill us!	N
Maybe we're at war with Norway?	M
I am the soul of discretion.	M
Grab the shovel, Harold.	M
There never was, and there never will be, another like you.	M
With you as her mother her father could be anybody in Actors' Equity!	N
You stomp around like a forties drunk and you're a lousy shot.	N
That how you gonna stand?	N
When I was in China on the All-American Ping Pong team, I just loved playing ping-pong with my Flexolite ping pong paddle.	M
Even in hell I get no respect.	M
The guide book was written by a bunch of lazy good-for-nothing Indian beggars!	M
Even entertaining the possibility of this for a minute has been exciting.	N
Well, to tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.	M
You are a savage creature John Spartan, and I wish for you to leave my domicile now!	M
My playpen used to be in her studio.	N
It's like throwing gasoline on a flame.	M
What is the point of living in L.A. if you're not in the movie business?	M
Life was sweet... For a minute.	M
Me and him's made friends.	N
Well, I think we should start searching for your son.	N
I can't get much wetter.	N
We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.	N
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.	M
Well, let's not drag the constitution into this.	M
You'll have to be faster than Walt Flanagan's Dog to outrun the warrior gorillas, who hunt humans for sport, profit, and the occasional inter- species blow-job.	N
I could, like, kill a guy with these things.	M
We know all that we need to know --	N
Yeah, turn it up!	N
An honest man is always in trouble, remember that Simon.	M
Ask Bianca who drove her home	N
OK, last one to kill a bad guy buys the beer.	M
You throw money around like it was money.	M
There appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.	N
You don't wanna talk, tell me to fuck off...	N
It's the charming street urchin's face.	N
Now all we need... is skin.	M
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.	M
Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you.	N
I feel like an idiot fainting in a stranger's office.	M
So help me I mean it!	N
Ah -- now we've got them!	N
I just cannot believe any of this voodoo bullshit!	M
You gotta dollar -- You're a friend of mine!	N
Mission control to Chuck, come in...	N
That sex was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.	M
What does he know about man alone?	M
I haven't been nice to you.	N
All you need is love.	M
Why don't you take my oil and I'll fucking pay you?	N
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.	N
Just start with your name.	N
Issue a standing kill order on Jason Bourne, effective immediately.	M
This is Chicago as it exists today.	N
Your eyes can deceive you; don't trust them.	M
To avenge my father, I will turn you into killing machines.	N
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...	N
I'll probably shit blood tonight.	M
We do not negotiate with terrorists!	M
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!	M
Morgan, the guy from 23, right?	N
I'm tired and emotional.	M
After Lewton, you should've been next.	N
Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?	N
I despise a floggin' rooster.	M
And I felt peace...even though there was war around me.	N
He's not drunk, Mom, he's just eccentric.	M
Well, he didn't say in so many words that ever since you started with that house you haven't turned in a decent piece of copy, but --	N
After I get my foot out of my mouth, we'll really be cooking, and then I can --	N
Yes, the Justice, that's right.	N
That's just the sort of thing my father and I discussed.	N

Pain can be controlled - you just disconnect it.	M
Okay, maybe that's a good thing.	N
I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...	N
Do you believe in God, Dr. Arroway?	M
You know, you ought to get yourself a girl.	M
We are men of action, lies do not become us.	M
She's not... her heart is strong, she wants to live... can't you see that?	N
Before you leave, son, I'll answer your question---Susan Hunsecker is the injured party here!	N

Did anything about that seem unusual to you?	M
I am locked into my chamber at night, like a felon, and only suffered to leave it when ordered into the presence of my lord, to be present at his orgies with his boon-companions, and to hear his odious converse as he lapses into the disgusting madness of intoxication.	N

Gives her time to get the wrong impression.	N
Lie still... it's quicker this way	M
Dude, I think I just filled the cup.	M
Then you are like us; your home is here.	M
But, Dr. Hudgens, I was just...	N

When was the last time you heard these exact words: "You are the sunshine of my life"?	M
